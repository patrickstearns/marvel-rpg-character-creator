            public String getNotes(){ return "The Powers referred to by the word \"Magic\" cannot be easily categorized in the other Power classes. It is, as Jeff Grubb so quaintly put it in the Players' Book of the Marvel Super Heroes Advanced Set, \"a can of worms that, once opened, may be difficult to contain.\" The subject of Magic in the Marvel Universe is dealt with at length by Kim Eastland's book, Realms of Magic (MHAC9). However, the book you're reading couldn't be called The Ultimate Powers Book if it simply shunted you off to Mr. Eastland's book now, could it? This section is for those players and Judges who are not following following a strict interpretation of the aforementioned tome or are simply interested in forging a Magic system that is unique to their campaign. It can be treated as a supplement to, explanation of, or replacement for your current magic system. If a Magic Power appears at any time during the character generation process, the player should convert the entire character to a Mage and convert all the Powers into their Magical equivalents. If the character was a High Tech type or possessed a physical type that was obviously technological in nature, these should be altered to reflect a Magical background for the character. For example, Robots might be now considered to be clockwork automatons or Galatea-like animated statues. The research for this book revealed that those Powers most often referred to as Magic had two basic components in the way they operated. I call these components Mechanism and Effect. Mechanism is the manner in which the, hero manifests his Magical Power. There are ten basic types of Mechanisms with an infinite number of further variations. These further variations are the actual “spells” that produce a specific Power/ Effect. When the Player rolls his first Magical Power, he must select a Mechanism. He can,choose one of those listed below or let pure chance decide. Upon gaining further Magical Powers, the player can stay with that first Mechanism or have another go at random determination.<table><tr><td>Die Roll</td><td>Mechanism</td></tr><tr><td>01-08</td><td>Word</td></tr><tr><td>09-20</td><td>Chant</td></tr><tr><td>21-28</td><td>Song</td></tr><tr><td>29-40</td><td>Gesture</td></tr><tr><td>41-52</td><td>Alchemy</td></tr><tr><td>53-60</td><td>Talisman</td></tr><tr><td>61-68</td><td>Familiar</td></tr><tr><td>69-76</td><td>Necromancy</td></tr><tr><td>77-84</td><td>Summoning</td></tr><tr><td>85-00</td><td>Ritual</td></tr></table> <br>Word—The hero needs to speak a single, specific word in order to manifest his Power. Subtle variations in pronunciation change the range, direction, and Intensity of the Effect. The higher the Effect's rank, the harder the required Word is to pronounce properly.<br>Chant—The hero needs to recite a series of words to manifest his Power. The Chant can be any length and form. Generally, the rank of the Effect determines the length of the Chant. The Chant lasts one turn for each ten points of the Power rank number. For example, a Chant of Incredible effect takes 4 turns. Song—The hero need to sing or play a specific song, tune, or rhythm to bring about the desired Effect. The name is a misnomer, since the nature of the Song can be as diverse as words-and-music, a hummed tune, a series of notes on an instrument, or an exotic drumbeat. The Song lasts one turn for each ten points of the Power rank number. For example, a Song of Shift X Effect takes 15 turns to be properly performed. <br>Gesture—The hero must perform a specific physical action to bring about the desired Effect. The nature and complexity of Magic Gestures varies. They can be hand and arm movements, facial expressions, acrobatics, dance steps, and or anything else the player can think of. The Effect determines the complexity and performance time of the Gesture—To properly perform a Gesture takes one turn per twenty points of the Effect's Power rank number. For example, a Monstrous Effect takes four turns to properly execute. <br>Alchemy—The hero can achieve a specific Effect by following a recipe that combines arcane or even commonplace substances in a special procedure. The resulting substance possesses enough Power to attempt the desired Effect. The length of preparation time and the cost of the ingredients increases with the rank of the Effect. Prep time is one turn per each ten points of the Power rank number. <br>The ingredients cost an amount of Resource points equal to 10% of the Effect's rank. For example, an Effect of Shift Y rank would require materials of Excellent cost stirred together for 20 turns.<br>Talisman—The Mage must possess a specific item in order to achieve his desired Effect. This can be a specific type of item for each type of spell, such as a marble sphere to communicate with spirits or a handful of eagle feathers to achieve flight. Common talismans have a cost of one Resource point for each point of the Effect's rank number. For example, a common talisman for a Remarkable Effect would cost 30 points. Much rarer is the Magical Talisman, a unique item that possesses its own Power or focuses the Mage's own Power. Magic Talismans are general purpose devices that can serve the Mage's every need, regardless of the type of Effect desired. An example of this is Dr. Strange's amulet, the Eye of Agamotto. Magic Talismans can be of any nature, whether jewelry, implements, clothing, or your grandfather's skull.<br>Familiar—The Mage possesses (or is possessed by) a special lifeform who serves as an amplifier, conduit, and transmitting device for the Mage's Power. The hero must be in contact with the Familiar to achieve any type of Effect aside from communication. The Familiar can be any species, but generally is a non-sentient being of a lower order of life than the Mage's physical form. The Familiar's speciers is usually from the same world or dimension as the Mage. Of course, if the Mage is of a higher order than humans, he might have a human as a Familiar. The relationship between Mage and Familiar bonds them together so well that they can Telepathically communicate with each other. Common examples of Familiars include felines and owls.<br>Necromancy—The Mage can achieve an Effect by using the remnants of lifeforce contained in once-living biological materials. Unfortunately for everybody concerned, the most potent source of this lifeforce is a living organism which the Necromancer must slay in order to have the benefit of its lifeforce. Necromancy is the nastiest form of Magic there is. If the player rolls this form, he has three options. One, continue creating the character and then give him to the Judge for use as an NPC villain. Two, say the magic word \"Drat!,\" discard this Mechanism, and roll again. Three, go with this Mechanism and assume that your Mage is an \"enlightened\" Necromancer who only uses already deceased materials and is a valiant foe of nasty, evil, \"unenlightened\" Necromancers who still do things the old fashioned way. Higher ranked Effects require harder to acquire body bits. The Judge will have to decide his own standards for this. For example, a dead mouse is required for a Feeble Effect while 400-year-old bones of somebody named Fredrikson might be required for a Shift-X Effect.<br>Summoning—The Mage can summon supernatural beings and compel/ bribe/ beg them to go do the actual work that produces the Effect. Such beings include Spirits, Angels, Demons, and any other Magical Beings who might exist in the Judge's campaign. Generally speaking, each Summoner specializes in a particular type of Magical creature. The Summoner can draw on the services of other types but this is an unlikely event brought about by special circumstances. For example, Illyana Rasputin can summon a variety of Demons but has never tried to summon a Ghost. The overall Power rank of the being to be summoned is dictated by the rank of the desired Effect. (If the being can't do the job then why summon it in the first place?) The Mage runs into danger as he attempts to summon more Powerful beings, many of whom might resent the Mage for dragging them away from their home dimension and sending them off on some ridiculous mission. Should the Mage loses control of the situation, things might get nasty, messy, and probably fatal. <br>Ritual—This is a combination of any of the preceding nine Mechanisms into a compound Mechanism. The player rolls the dice to determine how many Mechanisms are to be combined into the Ritual.<table><tr><td>Die Roll</td><td>#</td></tr><tr><td>01-33</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>34-67</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>68-00</td><td>4</td></tr></table><br>The player then returns to the Mechanism listing at the beginning of this section and randomly generates the component Mechanisms. Duplicate rolls simply means that an extra effort is needed; that Mechanism is twice as complicated as your Mage had initially thought. Examples of Ritual combinations include Word/Gesture, Chant/Talisman, and Song/Dance.<br>Mechanisms are only effective if used by someone who actually possesses Magical Power. Mechanisms can be imitated by normal people but the Effect won't occur because the imitator doesn't have the Power to support the mimicry.  So forget about tape-recording Chants and playing them back whenever you want. Of course, if the Mechanism is imitated by someone who didn't know that they possessed Magical Power, then the Effect might unexpectedly occur. <br>For example, the famous choreographer Rob Fusse created a ballet that incorporated dance steps he'd once witnessed in a Tibetan temple. He didn't know that the dance was really a Weather Control spell. He also didn't krow that his lead dancer was a budding Sorceress; she didn't know it either. On the opening night, the dancer's excitement finally allowed her latent Power to connect with the spell she was unwittingly casting, with torrential results. Critics hailed it as a new triumph in bringing realism into the theatre.<br>Curiously, if anyone who possesses Powers other than Magic tries to imitate a Mechanism, there is a chance it will succeed. In such a case, the mimic's own Powers provide the raw energy to achieve the Effect. Such a mimicry requires two red Reason FEATs to succeed. The first FEAT means that some kind of Effect has been achieved, while the second means the Effect is under the mimic's control.<br>Example: Kitty Pride has been watching Illyana Rasputin closely in order to figure out how Illyana creates space warps. Kitty tries to imitate her friend's actions. Kitty's Remarkable Reason gives her a slim chance of success. She lucksout the first phase (a 95) and vanishesinto a glowing circle of light.<br>Unfortunately she botched the second phase (a 32) and didn't reappear at poolside as she intended. An hour later Professor X accepts a collect call from Bristol, England. It's Kitty, asking if somebody could come get her. The second Component to Magic is the Effect. It's just another word for the Power the player has already acquired through the Power Generation process. There are twelve Powers that are unique to the Magic classification. Since Mages often display Magical Powers that are virtually identical to more normal Powers, the system had to account for those as well. These are handled under the category of Power Simulation."; }

An Amazing FEAT reflects some of the attack back onto the attacker; it is now -3CS in Intensity. An Unearthly FEAT sends the entire attack back onto the attacker. If the attack's Intensity is higher that this Power's rank, some of the damage passes through and affects the hero. The Power rank is subtracted from the attack's Intensity. While most of the attack is reflected, the remainder gets through to the hero. Example: The terrible Turnabout is battling X-Factor. Cyclops fires an optic blast of Remarkable Intensity. Turnabout possesses Excellent Reflection. His Power splits the blast in two. A Feeble blast penetrates his Power and knocks Turnabout back. The bulk of the blast was reflected. Turnabout made an Amazing FEAT, so some of Cyclops' blast returns to him. Cyke takes Typical damage from his own Power. Normally, this Power is consciously controlled and only appears when the hero wills it. However, the Power can be turned against the hero by such means as Power Control/Magnification and Power Domination. In such cases, the Power can be magnified beyond the hero's control to a level where it reflects everything, including air, food, and water. The Power can be used indefinitely, so long as it isn't overcome by superior force. After the first time the Power is breached, the hero must make a green FEAT. Failure to do so means his Power has failed. After the second breach, the hero must make a yellow FEAT. For each breach following that, he must make a red FEAT.

She then refined that Light Generation into a variety of effects, including lasers, light shields, and hypnotic effects. The second advantage is the ability to transform deadly force into less dangerous forms. For example, if your hero found himself caught in a raging firestorm, he might Convert the heat into Cold. This would both protect him and extinguish the fire. (The paramedic shook his head. \"I'll be danged if I can figure out how a man can get frostbite fighting a fire.\") The maximum Intensity of Energy that a hero can convert is equal to one rank higher than his Power rank (a red FEAT).

The hero may also choose to harmlessly dissipate the energy over a long period; this is a number of turns equal to the Intensity rank number. For example, your hero soaks up an Incredible radiation blast. He chooses to re-release it later as a single, Excellent Intensity blast that could really muck up whatever it hit, or he could let the radiation slowly seep away (this takes 40 turns, or four minutes). When the hero reaches his limit, three things can happen. One, the hero simply cannot absorb any more energy until he releases what he has already soaked up. This assumes the hero is in control of the situation and has a choice in his actions. The second possibility is that a \"gag reflex\" takes effect. Just as a human expels all food when the intake limit is reached, so too will the hero simply, uncontrollably release all absorbed energy at once. This situation assumes the hero doesn't know his own limit, or has a low Intuition (Typical or lower). The third possibility is dangerous for the hero. If he attempts to absorb more than his limit, he may suffer physical damage. The hero can temporarily absorb greater amounts of energy by making repeated red FEATs.

All absorbed energy is released in a single turn, doing full damage to the hero. If the hero makes one last red FEAT, he takes only half damage but loses the Power permanently. Example: The alien hero Sukupp possessed an Excellent level of the Energy Sponge Power. While he was visiting Charleston, terrorists detonated an atomic bomb of Monstrous Intensity. Sukupp had no choice but to try to absorb the blast. He made his first red FEAT and absorbed 30 points of the blast. He didn't have time to release it, nor was this the proper place; the fireball was growing. He made his next red FEAT and absorbed another 10 points. A third red FEAT allowed him to absorb an Amazing amount of radiation, minus the points already absorbed (50-40=10). Sukupp now had 50 points of the Ablast's 75 soaked into his body. There was still enough free to contaminate the city. Sukupp had to absorb it all. He tried. He failed the last red FEAT. For second, his body glowed like a small star. Than, he was gone.

For example, an auto battery can be drained on a Typical Intensity FEAT, a gallon of gasoline by Good Intensity FEAT, the magnetism every tape in a music shop on an Excellent intensity FEAT, the heat of a blast furnace on an Amazing Intensity FEAT and so on. Living and/or sentient targets are harder to drain, because they possess Psyche. The target's Psyche determines the Intensity of the FEAT needed. A successful FEAT enables the hero to drain energy from the target. The amount drained is equal to this Power's rank number. The amount is drawn from all the target's Energy Emission Powers and any energies that form his physical make-up; this applies if the hero is a non-human (a robot, for example). The Energy Vampire can only drain Powers that actually emit energy—see the Energy Emission section. Powers that do not emit energy cannot be affected by this Power (but, see Power Vampirism). The Energy Vampire can drain the Power rank number amount of energy each turn as long as he keeps making successful FEATs. He can voluntarily stop feeding at any point by making a Psyche FEAT roll of any color except red. A red FEAT means his hunger is beyond his control. He has entered a feeding frenzy that will only cease when the target has been completely drain of energy. If the Energy Vampire fails to make any FEAT during the feeding process, he breaks off his attack and cannot reestablish it. The victim instantly develops an immunity to that particular Energy Vampire, and cannot be subjected to any of his future attacks. However, this does not protect the victim from other Energy Vampires. The drained energy is added in equal amounts to the Vampire's Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any other Powers he possesses. The exception is this Power; no Vampire of any type can increase his own Power. Example: Evan the Energy Vampire possesses Good Energy Vampirism. His intended victim is Heatwave, a human with two Powers (Typical Gliding and Excellent Heat Emission) and Good Psyche. Evan makes the required FEAT roll (not red) to begin feeding, and drains 10 points from his victim's highest Power rank number. Heatwave's Heat Emission loses 10 points and drops to Good. Evan's three abilities go up 3 points each, thus increasing his Health by 6. The next turn, Evan makes another FEAT and drains another 10 points, drawn equally from Heatwave's Psyche and Heat Emission (dropping each by 5 points). Add another 3 points to Evan's three abilities and another 6 to his Health. The next FEAT is a repeat performance. At this point, Evan's player decides he's had enough, and rolls a 43; quitting is no problem. Why do Energy Vampires do it? Due to their odd nature, they lose energy at a dreadful rate. Their rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, and Psyche, and all Powers (except this one), drop 1 point per hour. The Energy Vampire must feed to bring those abilities and Powers up to their original levels. An Energy Vampire cannot actually starve to death; when all his affected rank numbers reach Shift 0, he enters a deathlike trance. His Vampirism continues to function and tries to drain anything that comes in contact with him. When the Vampire's abilities return to Feeble, he returns to life. When creating the Energy Vampire, the player must choose a weakness. He can increase the Power rank by +1CS by choosing a second weakness, up to a maximum of +3CS (four weaknesses) for the Energy Vampire. Energy Vampirism is communicable.

        WeaponsCreation(PowerClass.Fighting, "Weapons Creation", 2, 0.05, "<b>Weapons Creation</b>: The hero can create any desired weapon out of thin air. The weapon can be of any design, size, and material. The size of the weapon is limited by its weight. The hero can only create in a single turn a maximum number of ounces equal to his Power rank number. Heavier weapons have to be assembled in pieces over a span of several turns. While the material strength of the created weapon is the same as that of a normally-manufactured weapon of the same type, its duration is much shorter. The lifespan of the weapon is determined at the time of creation. A Typical Intensity FEAT gives the weapon a lifespan of 100 turns times the hero's Reason rank number. On an Amazing Intensity FEAT, the weapon lasts for the hero's Reason rank number times 10,000 turns. Should he make an Unearthly Intensity FEAT, the weapon will be permanent. Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs the hero 1 Health point. All points lost in this manner are regained after 24 hours. Thus, the hero can only create a weapon weighing the number of ounces equal to his Health score in a single day. The hero must have-detailed knowledge of any weapon he wants to create. He can only store a limited number of weapons' designs in his memory. The total number of memory slots available to this Power equals the hero's Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the weapons he can create. This list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the hero a new design. If no open memory slots are available, an old design is tossed away to make room for the new one. Normally, the Power is used to make facsimiles of existing weapons. The hero must make a detailed study of the weapon for at least 10 minutes before attempting a FEAT. Failure to make the FEAT means the hero must spend another 10 minutes studying the weapon before attempting another FEAT. Some weapons might be beyond the hero's comprehension, if the player has really bad luck when rolling the dice. The hero can create new weapons based solely on his imagination and basic knowledge of weapons design. This requires intense concentration and a red Power rank FEAT. The newly created weapon has the same characteristics as a normally created one of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary weapons, the player and Judge should agree on a reasonable and playable set of characteristics for the weapon in question. The Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each element or compound takes up its own memory slot, just like the throwing daggers and broadswords that clutter the hero's mind. Such raw matter can be formed into any weapon's shape. This permits the hero to change the composition of any already-memorized designs. For example, if he has already memorized the design of an arrow and the nature of silver he can create both wood and steel arrows and silver arrows. Weapons created materialize in the hero's hands. There is an exception to the rules thus far. When creating the hero, the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of a special weapon. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Such special weapons are never permanent; Unearthly Intensity FEATs are treated the same as Amazing Intensity ones. One example of this option is Magik's Soulsword. The Optional Power for this is a form of Martial Arts Supremacy that uses a special weapon, as in the option explained above. The Nemesis Power is True Invulnerability."){

        WeaponsTinkering(PowerClass.Fighting, "Weapons Tinkering", 1, 0.20, "<b>Weapons Tinkering</b>: The hero can devise and assemble any weapon that can be made with the available materials. By means of a red FEAT, the hero can even improvise a means of creating unavailable materials (adamantium, for example). Provided he has the resources, the hero can assemble a functional copy of any weapon. As to what weapons he can make, use the Resource costs listed in the Hardware section of the Player's Book (pages 42-46). Compare the Power's rank with the cost of the desired weapon. Equal or lower cost weapons can be created on a green FEAT. A cost of one to three levels higher requires a yellow FEAT. A cost of four to six levels higher requires a red FEAT. If the cost of the desired weapon is more than six levels higher than the hero's Power rank, it is an impossible FEAT. Example: Dr. Fixit has Excellent Weapons Tinkering and access to his brother-in-law's junkyard. He wants to build a battle-copter with adamantium armor. The copter has an Amazing cost. True adamantium has a Shift X cost; secondary adamantium has an Unearthly cost. Dr. Fixit makes the yellow FEAT; his copter will work. He doesn't have any adamantium, though, and tries to improvise. He fails to make a red FEAT; neither batch of \"home-brewed\" adamantium worked. Oh well, he can always convert that old boiler he found into armor plate. When creating the hero, the player can choose to make the character a jack-ofall- trades or specialist in a particular field. If he chooses to specialize, he can raise the rank +2CS. Categories of weapons include: Edged and Blunt weapons Projectile weapons Energy weapons Heavy weapons Battle weapons Alien weapons Battlesuits War robots Needless to say, the player will have to develop stats for anything he comes up with. If he successfully copies existing technology, like the Iron Man battlesuit or a SHIELD Plasma Beam Handgun, he can simply use the established stats for that device. Weapons Locker (MHAC8) by Epperson and Grubb is a valuable aid to the player of a hero with this Power. A clever character can also use this Power to make money off of other characters by building weapons on commission.

        //Illusory
        AnimateImage(PowerClass.Illusionary, "Animate Image", 1, 0.15, "<b>Animate Image</b>: This is a specialized form of Illusion-casting that enables the hero to apparently bring any flat image to life. Whatever the original nature of the image—drawing, painting, photograph, print—the image gains threedimensionality and independent movement. A blank white area now fills the area formerly occupied by the newly solidified Image. In actuality, the hero has created two Illusions. The obvious one is the Animated Image that has peeled itself away from its flat background and filled out into three dimensions. The second, more subtle Illusion is the \"blank white area.\" The hero automatically casts this Illusion to mask out the still-existing original picture; this secondary Illusion lasts for 10-20 turns or until the primary Illusion ceases to exist, whichever comes first. The initial range at which the hero can Animate an Image is line-of-sight for one area. This is also the maximum range at which the hero can normally maintain the \"realism\" of the Image. Simply put, the hero has to be able to clearly see both the Image and its surroundings. When either is beyond his vision, the believability of the Image drops drastically. When the Image gets beyond the hero's field of clear vision, he can no longer make it realistically conform to the surroundings. Example: Kinescope Animates a lion off of a circus poster and sends it after some muggers. The muggers flee around a corner, the lion in pursuit. Unbeknownst to Kinescope, the alley is full of trash cans, which the lion blithely passes through. The muggers see this and realize they've been had. Kinescope gets a surprise when he comes around the corner. The Image can exist for as long as the hero concentrates on maintaining it (the Judge is free to determine how easily this can be done given the circumstances the hero finds himself in). Although the Image can only be realistically controlled within one area of the hero's location, the Image can be projected up to the full range for this Power. Once beyond the one area limit, the Image is easily perceived by others as a holographic projection. The hero can overcome this limit by extending the range of his own senses, either through artificial means (telescopes, remote TV camera, etcetera) or by using sense extending Powers. In such cases, the hero can extend realistic control of the Image up to the range limits for this Power and whatever means he employs to extend his vision. Example: Kinescope has an Excellent rank for this Power and can project an Image up to 25 areas (3300 feet) away. He also has Good Clairvoyance with a maximum range of 2500 miles. By using both Powers, he can maintain the realism of his Images up to the maximum range of 25 areas even through any vision-blocking barriers. The Image possesses whatever abilities or characteristics the original model possessed. At least, it possesses those abilities or characteristics the hero believes the model possessed. This is after all an Illusion that the hero has created. As such, it conforms to his expectations. What traits the Image has are determined by the hero's imagination and memory for detail. The accuracy of the Image is determined by the hero's Reason. A green FEAT creates an Image that is somehow flawed; it might move the wrong way, lack a shadow, have no surface detail, and so on. A yellow FEAT creates an Image that are nearly exact; a close visual examination is required to distinguish the Image from reality. A red FEAT creates a perfect Illusion. The typical Animated Image is an intangible holographic projection. Since most people rely 'exclusively on their vision as the means of sensing their environment, the Animated Image is easily accepted as reality. Only when other senses are used does the Image get exposed as Illusion. Such Images are mechanically detectable and recordable by such means as photography and television. Images can also deceive the artificial senses of mechanical beings. The Animated Image is initially strictly composed of light. It lacks the other sensory details of a real object, most notably the sounds and smells of the original. These can be simulated to give the Animated Image greater reality. The Talent of Ventriloquism or such Powers as Speechthrowing or Vocal Control can add speech and incidental noises to the image. Sensory Manipulation can create, deceptions of smell, temperature difference, and even tactile sensations. The coherent light of the Image blocks normal light and creates normal shadows. Since the Image is intangible, it cannot directly do physical damage to a target. If the Image incorporates bright light, it has the potential of blinding the target. How ever, if the hero possesses certain other Powers that can be combined with the Image then it can do actual damage. If the hero also uses Energy Solidification or any of the Matter Creation Powers, the Image gains temporary solidity. This lasts for 1 -10 turns, regardless of the normal duration of effect for the supplementing Power. Note: this is determined by the Judge, not the player. Any of the Energy Emission Powers can be apparently redirected through the Image. For example, if the hero possessed both Animate Image and Fire Generation, he could create a hazardous simulation of the Human Torch. This Power can be combined with certain Psionic Powers to create Images that do psychosomatic damage to a target. These Psionics, include Telepathy, Mental Domination, Hypnotic Control, and Neural Manipulation. Psychosomatic damage occurs because the target believes in the reality of the Image and thus the. -reality of any damage the Image is inflicting upon him. For example, Kinescope combines his Powers of Animate Image and Neural Manipulation to create an Image of a boa constrictor. The boa enwraps Kinescope's opponent, who believes he is being crushed and passes out from his imagined loss of breath. Psychosomatic damage can be resisted by any target who becomes aware of the Image's lack of reality. Be warned that psychosomatic damage can lead to fatal results if the target succumbs to a heart attack or stroke. Note also that psychosomatic damage cannot affect non-sentient minds. Animated Images can be of any nature, but are generally used to simulate moveable objects and lifeforms. In all cases, the hero must have an actual image to work from. The Animated Image that results is the same size as the original image. Not all of the model has to be present in the original image; the hero can fill in the rest from his imagination. As he brings the Animated Image to life, it climbs out of the frame, revealing previously unshown parts. For example, Kinescope Animates a head-and-shoulders portrait of Lincoln. The visible parts immediately spring out; the rest of Abe's body is revealed as he climbs out of the frame. Animate Image can be used to alter images within the plane of the original picture. The hero can alter the placement of sections of the picture or give them flat animation, even making sections of the picture apparently withdraw from the depicted scene. While the previous commentary has spoken of this Power in terms of translating two dimensional images to three-dimensional objects, it can also be used to simulate animation for already three-dimensional objects, like statues or stuffed animals. This can be developed as a Power Stunt. The hero uses an existing object for a model to base his Illusions on. The primary Illusion is the statue or whatever coming to life; the secondary Illusion renders Illusory Invisibility around the original. The characteristics for the Image are a combination of the statue's material composition and those traits the hero imagines the model for the statue possessed. Example: Kinescope encounters thieves outside the Cleveland Art Museum. He casts his Power on Rodin's bronze, \"The Thinker,\" that sits in front of the museum. The Image that results is a 15-foot-tall man made entirely of bronze and consequently extremely strong and heavy. By using his Power in this way, the hero can simulate any of the Matter Animation, Control, and Conversion Powers. Optional Powers include either Telescopic Vision or Clairvoyance, Energy Solidification, and either Elemental or Molecular Creation. The Nemesis Powers are either Sonar or Radar, combined with temporary blindness."){

        IllusionCasting(PowerClass.Illusionary, "Illusion Casting", 2, 0.55, "<b>Illusion-Casting</b>: The hero can create realistic holographic images that have apparent solidity. These Illusions can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography or television. That separates this Power from the psionic, image-generating Power called Hallucinations, which produces images directly in the target's mind and cannot affect mechanical senses. The Illusion can take any size or appearance the hero desires and is limited only by his imagination. The Illusion can be a realistic simulation, a fanciful creation direct from the hero's mind, or an abstract display of light. The hero is playing with light itself and can create anything that is visible. Since most people depend. on vision to gain information on their surroundings, this Power presents the awesome ability to apparently alter the nature of reality. The hero can cast his Illusions anywhere within his Power rank range, though he must be able to clearly see the area where the Illusion is forming if he wants to make it at all realistic. The normal limit for unaided vision is one area (132 feet). Beyond that range the hero can no longer clearly see his Illusion's surroundings and thus cannot alter the Illusion to reflect things going on around the Illusion. For example, an Illusionary tree cast two areas away might seem to be floating a discreet two inches above the ground. If the hero is unconcerned about maintaining the reality of his Illusions, this limit can be ignored. The hero does not even need to be able to see the Illusion as it forms. Such uncontrolled Illusions appear as transparent, freefloating apparitions. If the Illusion takes the form of a living being, viewers might see it as a ghost or other phantom form. If the hero possesses a means of extending the range of his senses, he can maintain the realism m of his Illusion at up to full range of both this Power and that of whatever means he uses to extend his vision. Ways of increasing the senses' range include mechanical means such as binoculars and remote TV cameras and sense-extending Powers, most notably Telescopic Vision and Clairvoyance. Example: Deetee has an Incredible rank and can Illusion-Cast up to two miles away. She also has a good pair of binoculars that enable her to see up to one mile away. For idle amusement, she likes to go to the top of tall buildings and Cast Illusions at the pedestrians below. She also like to find the monitors for remote surveillance cameras and use them to direct her Illusions into locked rooms. Illusions last as long as the hero concentrates on maintaining their existence. The Judge is free to determine how long the hero can maintain his concentration in a given circumstance. Breaking the hero's concentration abruptly terminates the Illusion, while merely getting distracted causes the Illusion to begin to lose realism (drift, lose detail, become translucent, and so on). The Illusion's effect on a viewer varies. A viewer must make an Intuition FEAT against the Power rank of the Illusion-caster; success means the viewer now recognizes the Illusion's true nature. Players running characters viewing an Illusion are only allowed to make a FEAT if they suspect the Illusion. This can occur if they physically touch the Illusion, if the Illusion is somehow flawed, or if the character is just naturally cynical. (\"Congratulations, Les. So far this morning you have attempted to disbelieve the existence of a flying saucer, Galactus, two muggers, and your breakfast.\"). Since Illusion-Casting includes the Power of Light Control, Illusions can provide a measure of protection against light-based attacks. An Illusory tent would provide protection against both infrared and ultraviolet light, thus keeping the hero cool and safe from sunburn. Treat this Power as +2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks. It does not provide protection against any of the other ways Moms Nature has of affecting us. That Illusory tent would be drafty, cold, and flimsy. Illusion Casting can be combined with other Powers to give 1he Illusion enhanced realism; this can also create Illusions that do real physical damage. If the Illusion-caster has any of the Energy Emission Powers, these can be redirected to apparently originate from the Illusion rather than from the hero. For example, combining this Power with Plasma Generation would simulate the Phoenix-force and fry any electronics in the area. More commonly, the power is used to disguise the true nature of anything the hero or her companions might be doing. Example: Deetee and her buddy Jayboy have to break into a certain building that they know is under surveillance. Deetee doesn't care about subtlety, only About distraction, and casts an Illusion of a,.Large elephant that comes lumbering around a corner and lies down in front of the door. Inside the elephantine Illusion, Jayboy is free to use his Kinetic Bolt Power to smash open the door. He also uses his K-bolts to simulate the effect the elephant's legs have when they kick against a target. The main drawback to Illusion-Casting is that the hero must keep his Power's true nature a secret from his adversaries. It must be presented as if it were another Power entirely. For example, although she is an Illusion-caster, Deetee often presents herself as a Demon-Summoner. Even if the Power's nature is public knowledge, the Power is still effective. The Powers of Light Emission and Light Control are innate factors of Illusion Casting. As such, the hero has the ability to generate any intensity and frequency of light. He can warp light, alter its frequency, and change its degree of coherency. The hero can do -2CS rank level damage using light-based attacks. As noted earlier, the Power includes - 2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks; the hero simply casts an Illusion of something opaque between herself and the offending light. The hero can simulate other visual Powers or Talents with some effectiveness as well; the -2CS limit is used as a guide for determining how well the hero can do these things. Example: Once inside the building, Deetee and Jay-boy discover a guard. Deetee casts an Illusion of Ringmaster and tries to hypnotize the guard. Her Incredible rank is reduced to merely Excellent when she tries simulate Hypnotic Control. Fortunately that is enough; the guard falls under the spurious Ringmaster's control. Powers that are a part of or can be simulated by Illusion-Casting include: Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, Energy Detection (Light), Light Control, Shadowshaping, Hard Radiation Emission (UV Light), Heat (infrared Light), Light Emission, Shadowcasting, Animate Image, Illusory Invisibility, Illusory Duplication, Hypnotic Control, Coloration, Hallucinations, Blending, Energy Sheath (Light), Self-Vegetation, Shapeshifting.  A drawback in characters who have this Power is that they tend to become philosophical about the relationship between Reality and Illusion. Companions find themselves drawn into interminable arguments about what is real and what is not. Illusion-Casters may even begin to feel that they themselves are an Illusion being cast by some unknown being. Optional Powers include Energy Solidification, Telescopic Vision, and Clairvoyance.

        IllusoryInvisibility(PowerClass.Illusionary, "Illusory Invincibility", 1, 0.15, "<b>Illusory Invisibility</b>: This is not true Invisibility but is actually a clever simulation. The effects are nearly the same, anyway; the hero becomes effectively invisible to any living or artificial being. The hero actually remains visible but he can now surround himself with a holographic Illusion of empty space. This field can be limited to the hero's body or increased to cover a large area. The maximum radius of this effect is the number of feet equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Poor rank could cover an area extending four feet from the hero, a Monstrous rank could cover an area extending 75 feet, and a Class 1000 rank could cover a square mile. Within the, Illusory Invisibility, things remain visible. From the point of view of anyone within the Power's protection, it appears that the area has been surrounded by an irregularly-shaped transparent balloon that causes weird tricks of light. Outside the \"balloon\" a viewer sees only the Illusion of empty space, even if the viewer has just stepped out of the invisibility field. Standing at the edge of the field can result in a headache as the viewer's eyes see both the reality and the Illusion. This Power can be cast at a target point some distance away. The area limit is the same. The maximum range at which the Illusory Invisibility can appear is determined by the Power rank. For example, a Monstrous rank permits the hero to hide an area 150 feet wide (75 foot radius, remember?) located up to six miles away. Of course, the hero has to be able to see his intended target; otherwise he would be unable to simulate the appearance of emptiness appropriate to the target area. When casting this Power at ground level, a practical limit to range is one area (132 feet) from the hero. Casi!ng an Illusory Invisibility in the air or in space is easier and can be done at rank level range. Note that as this is an Illusion, it can be detected by careful visual examination or the simplest of physical tests. The \"empty space\" is only what the hero imagines such an empty space to look like. As the hero tries to hide more area, the problems of realism multiply. If the Illusory Invisibility and the viewer move in relationship to each other, the viewer might be able to detect a slight distortion of light at the edge of the field. (The player can imagine it by thinking of a clear drinking glass.) Example: Consider an airship surrounded by a mechanically created version of Illusory Invisibility. Inside the airship, vision is unaffected. The crew can clearly see the world below. The field extends one foot around the airship. From the ground and sides the ship is invisible. The flaw is when the field is viewed from above; a viewer sees the ground below but may realize that the surface detail is not continuous. Rivers And roads have sudden, unexplained gaps. Since the Invisibility is holographic in nature, it can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography, television, and the mechanical senses.of artificial oeings. It can also be seen at any distance and will deceive telescopes, remote cameras, and Telescopic Vision used outside the field's effect. Sensory Link can be deceived if that Power is used to link up with a viewer outside the field; if it is used to link with someone inside the field, the deception fails. Clairvoyance cannot detect Illusions at all and thus would also penetrate the deception. The Power cannot deceive any of the other senses or such Powers as Sonar, Radar, or Psionics. For example, Daredevil would be unaware of such a field even being employed; this can lead to Problems for Matt Murdock. (\"What I don't understand, DD, is how did you know the Dreadnought wasn't real?\") The Power provides limited protection against light-based attacks originating outside the field. This is equivalent to a Force Field vs. Light with a -2CS rank. For example, a Good form of this Power provides Poor protection against lasers and hypnotic lights. The main protection it offers is that if the viewer doesn't know there is something to shoot at, then he won't shoot. The Invisibility lasts as long as the hero can maintain his concentration. In the case of mechanically-derived Invisibility, it lasts for as long as the equipment functions. Judges are free to decide the difficulty of either case in any given circumstance. For example, the Judge decides that the above-mentioned airship's Invisibility Generator can function for up to ten hours of continuous operation but shuts down if it receives a single jolt of electricity with Amazing Intensity. The hero can terminate his Invisibility at any time, either purposely or accidentally. Simple physical contact can alert a viewer to the hero's presence, whether the hero accidentally envelops him in the field or the hero makes a distance attack at the target. A spray of a coating material will temporarily reveal the extent of the field; in the middle of an obscuring cloud, the field shows as a silhouette of clear air. Once the hero realizes that his field is visible, he can correct the Illusion to reflect the new addition to his surroundings; this takes a green Intuition FEAT. Note: the Judge should roll this for the hero without telling the player he has become visible; failure means the hero has either not yet realized his predicament or has not yet gotten the Illusion properly altered.

        IllusoryDuplication(PowerClass.Illusionary, "Illusory Duplication", 1, 0.15, "<b>Illusory Duplication</b>: This is a specialized form of Illusion-Casting that permits the hero to generate completely realistic simulations of a single object, namely himself. Unlike the other Illusory Powers, this permits the hero to see through these nonexistent senses and to communicate through apparently normal speech. The hero can create a finite number of exact holographic duplicates of himself. These are Illusions based on his selfimage, which the hero had best make sure matches his actual appearance at that moment. The accuracy of the Duplicate is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Duplicate is generated. A green Reason FEAT means the Illusory Duplicates are somehow different from the hero; they have the wrong outfit on, are too muscular or handsome, and so on. A yellow or red Reason FEAT produces a perfect copy. The maximum number of simultaneous Duplicates the hero can create is equal to his Power rank number. Although Duplicates are frequently used to surround the hero and act as decoys, the Duplicates can also function several areas or miles away from the hero. The maximum range at which the hero can either send or create a Duplicate is determined by his Power rank; specific levels are shown on column B. Example: Myriad has an Incredible rank. This enables him to create up to 40 simultaneously existing Duplicates that can form or travel as far as two miles away from his location. The Duplicates are intangible holographs and are incapable of doing any actual physical activity. They are primarily used as decoys, messengers, spies, and simulated ghosts. The Duplicates can form in any location within the hero's range, regardless of whether the hero can see that location or not. As an aspect of this Power, the hero automatically possesses a combination of Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, and Speechthrowing that permits him to see, hear, and speak through his remote Duplicates. For example, Myriad is at the scene of a cave-in. The rescue crew need to know where any survivors are located. Myriad creates several Duplicates and sends them off into the debris. Since these are energy, the Duplicates can pass effortlessly through the rock. Myriad sees what the Duplicates \"see.\" There is no light in the collapsed area but Myriad's Duplicates each carry an illusion of a flashlight that functions as well, if not better, than a real one. Finally two of the Duplicates find survivors., The first group of survivors are only lost; the Duplicate leads them through the darkness to safety. The second group is trapped behind fallen rock. They are startled when the Duplicate passes through the rock into their area but Myriad speaks through his Duplicate and appraises them of the situation. The Duplicate remains with them until the rescuers finally reach them. When creating the hero, the player has the option of assigning some or all of the hero's other Powers to the Duplicates. The hero can only create a single such Powerful Duplicate at any one time. Since this Duplicate now has a greater effect on reality, it gains some reality as well. Such Duplicates can be affected and even destroyed by such attacks as Light Emission, Light Generation, Plasma Generation, Plasma Control, Shadowcasting, and any of the Magics and Power Controls. The Duplicate has a \"Health\" equal to this Power's rank number. Any damage to the Duplicate is subtracted from this number. At zero the Duplicate suddenly vanishes. In addition, any damage done to the Duplicate is also suffered by the hero, who temporarily loses a number of points equal to his Power rank number. Such points are regained just like Health points. All Duplicates can be affected by the Powers of Light Control and Shadowcasting. Light Control can overpower, distort, and even destroy any Duplicate. It can be use to seize control of a Duplicate away from the hero; the effect is analogous to someone using Mind Control/ Puppetry on the hero's own body. Shadowcasting can surround the Duplicate in darkness and prevent the hero's Clairvoyance from operating. If the Shadowcasting has a greater rank, that Power can be used to destroy a Duplicate. Note: when a Duplicate is passing through solids, its \"eyes\" register total darkness. If the hero is unaware that Shadowcasting is being used against his Duplicates, then he will assume the continued darkness is the result of the Duplicate remaining within a solid mass and consequently will make no attempt to resist this clandestine attack. As stated earlier, all Duplicates are an illusionary manifestation of the hero's self-image. They need not be a single, static design but can change with the hero's whim. Generally, all Duplicates at a given moment will have the same shape. However, by means of a red Reason FEAT, the hero can create simultaneous Duplicates who have different appearances. All such differences are still based on the hero's own form. A red FEAT is needed for each different type of Duplicate. Example: Myriad maintains a secret identity as a physicist at a nuclear plant in Georgia. One day the plant is attacked by supervillains. Myriad must take action but his civilian identity must remain at his emergency post. Myriad forms a number of Duplicates. Most resemble his super heroic self but Myriad alters one to appear as his civilian self. The extra form requires additional concentration on Myriad's part and a red FEAT. The player blows it on the first roll (a 23), second roll (03), third roll (24), but finally makes it on the fourth roll (00). Myriad castigates himself on the additional 24 seconds it took him to generate the lab coat and glasses. While Duplicates are normally created as independent beings, the Power can also be cast around the hero's own body to immediately alter the hero's own appearance. This is usually used to make quick disguises and costume changes. If the hero so chooses, his entire super hero appearance and costume can be nothing more than such a Illusion wrapped around the hero's normal civilian self. This would definitely prevent anyone from finding your costume stashed in the back of the closet. In the previous example, Myriad had not thought to bring his costume to work and had to form one of his Duplicates around himself. The drawback is that if the hero loses concentration, consciousness, or Power, he also loses his costume. (The time Myriad was skinnydipping when a crisis struck resulted in major embarrassment for him and some unfortunate media exposure.) Nemesis Powers include Light Control and Shadowcasting."),

This is accomplished by sheer force of will and does not require any physical action on the hero's part, aside from touching the target. The Power can be used at a distance but each 10 feet separating the hero from the target reduces his effective Power by -1CS. The Power is normally concentrated on a single target, but the hero can affect as many targets as he desires. Each additional target also decreases the rank -1CS. For example, trying to affect two targets at a distance of 10 feet drops the hero's rank -4CS (-2CS per target). The result of any form of this Power is permanent. (What's the point of healing somebody if he's just going to drop dead later, right?) The actual ongoing effects continue for as long as the hero continues to use his Power. Once this is done, the target's natural healing abilities and rates revert to normal. There are seven forms of Biophysical Control, each with its own set of effects. The first four forms are benevolent, the last three are maievolent. Heroes who use the malevolent forms against sentient beings risk Karma and Popularity loss. When the hero is created, the player must choose one of these forms. He can select one or let the dice decide for him. <table><tr><td>Die Roll</td><td>Form</td></tr><tr><td>01-24</td><td>Healing</td></tr><tr><td>25-44</td><td>Regeneration</td></tr><tr><td>45-48</td><td>Revival</td></tr><tr><td>49-68</td><td>Damage Transferral</td></tr><tr><td>69-76</td><td>Decay</td></tr><tr><td>77-92</td><td>Disruption</td></tr><tr><td>93-00</td><td>Aging</td></tr></table> Healing—The hero can cure the damage caused by wounds, trauma, toxins', and disease. The hero can increase the target's Health by'an amount equal to the Power rank level. This is the maximum benefit the hero can give per day to one specific person. The color of the required FEAT is determined by the nature and severity of the damage. Green FEATs handle broken bones, non-terminal disease, and simple wounds. Yellow FEATs handle physical trauma, wounds to organs, non-fatal poisoning, and terminal diseases. Red FEATs handle mortal wounds, coronary attacks, strokes, toxic poisoning, and massive physical trauma. The Power seals the body and returns any still-living tissues to health. It cannot replace lost tissue. Regeneration—The hero has the ability to heal (as above) and can recreate large areas of lost tissue, such as severed limbs or destroyed organs. Limbs are regrown by a green FEAT, organs by a yellow FEAT, and brain and neural tissues by a red FEAT. Revival—The hero can actually bring the dead back to life. The Power rank number is the maximum number of days the target can have been deceased and still be revived. The condition of the corpse determines the color of the required FEAT. An intact, unembalmed, undecayed corpse is revived on a green FEAT. A decayed but intact corpse needs a yellow FEAT. A red FEAT is required for partial or embalmed remains. For example, a Good rank can revive a 1 0-day-old, slightly moldy body if the player rolls a 75 or better. The Power begins by healing and regenerating any damage to the body, especially the cause of death. Once the body is habitable again, the Power automatically summons the deceased spirit back and reconnects it with the body. If the spirit was already reincarnated into another body, the spirit splits into identical halves. One remains with the new body while the other half returns home. If the spirit is trapped, the hero can make an attempt to free him based on the Power rank of whatever is holding the spirit. Until the spirit returns, the body remains in a comatose state. Damage Transferral—The hero can heal another by apparently taking that damage from the victim and moving it into the hero. The Power first heals the target; the manner is the same as for Healing (above). Simultaneously, the hero's body reshapes itself into a duplication of the damage being healed. Once the target is healed, the hero's Self-Healing abilities (same rank) then cures this ersatz damage. A hero cannot heal another person until he has returned to normal. Decay—The hero can accelerate the cellular collapse of body tissue. The Power can cause Power rank damage per turn. The target becomes leprous, dies, and quickly crumbles to dust if the Power is used long enough. Disruption—The Power can upset the Smooth functioning of the physiology. The target suffers Power rank losses to his Health as he suffers anything from minor discomfort (nausea, chills) to fatal trauma (coronary attack). Aging—The Power can accelerate or reverse the aging process. The normal rate is multiplied by the Power rank number. For example, a Good rank can make aging occur at tenfold rate or go in reverse at an equal rate. A green FEAT accelerates aging. A yellow FEAT stops it. A red FEAT reverses it. As the victim's age changes, physiology and mental capacities change as well. While the Power can function as a Fountain of Youth, it can also be used to kill through old age or regression to protoplasm. A target can be protected from unwanted Biophysical Control by such Powers as Force Field Generation and True Invulnerability. Optional Powers include another io M of this Power. The Nemesis is either Immortality or Serial Immortality."){

The most common examples of Bio-Vampires are the traditional bloodsuckers like Dracula. Although all the traditional vampires were destroyed on Earth in the Marvel Universe, this does not prevent the player or Judge from creating a new race of BioVampires able to withstand the spells that finally destroyed Dracula. As a new type of Bio- Vampire, your character need not follow the traditional abilities and limitations associated with the old Vampires. It's a new world and a new Vampire. Bio-Vampires have a Bonus Power of Mind Control/Puppetry that renders their victims unable to physically struggle against the Bio-Vampire. However, the victim's Psyche remains uncontrolled; the victim continues to try to resist the Bio- Vampire's attack. The Bio-Vampire must make a Power FEAT to initiate the attack. The victim's Psyche determines the difficulty of the FEAT. The first successful FEAT means the victim is immobilized and the BioVampire can begin to feed. Each successful FEAT enables the Bio- Vampire to drain Health points from the victim. The amount drained is equal to the Power rank number. This is converted into energy that is divided equally among the ranks for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any Powers the vampire has except this one. No Vampiric Power can ever increase its own rank. The Bio-Vampire must make a FEAT each turn he continues to feed. He can voluntarily stop feeding at any point by making a Psyche FEAT roll of any colo except red. A red FEAT means the Bio. Vampire's hunger is beyond his control. He has entered a feeding frenzy that only stops when the victim is drained or the Bio-Vampire has been repulsed. If the Bio-Vampire fails a FEAT at any time in the feeding process, he is immediately repulsed from the victim and can never resume that attack. That victim gains instant immunity to any future vampiric attack by that particular Bio-Vampire. Why do Bio-Vampires do it? Because they lose energy at an accelerated rate. Their rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any Powers except Bio-Vampirism drop one point per hour. The Bio-Vampire must feed in order to maintain his life. Even if the Bio-Vampire is deprived of victims, he never actually starves to death. When all his affected ranks drop to Shift 0, the Bio-Vampire drops into a deathlike trance. His vampirism continues to function, although he can no longer actively seek out new biomaterials to consume. If such are made available to the body, the Power will immediately begin to return the Bio-Vampire to life. When the player creates the BioVampire, he must choose and playa weakness. The Bio-Vampire's Power rank can be increased +1CS for each additional weakness the Bio-Vampire possesses, up to a maximum of four weaknesses in all. Bio-Vampirism is communicable. A sentient victim who was,completely drained as a result of a feeding frenzy must make a Psyche FEAT roll. A red result means the victim has arisen as a new, Feeble-ranked Bio-Vampire."),

Innate safe-guards in the Power maintain the target's lifeforce for as long as the target is in the altered state. Such states are not necessarily mobile, but if they are, they may require the target to move in new ways. While in a solid altered state, the target retains his overall normal appearance. If liquid or gaseous, he can assume any shape but can still automatically revert to his original shape when the Power's effects end. When transforming a target, the hero normally changes the entire body unless the player states beforehand which specific section he is changing. The safeguards still take effect, but the target loses sensation in the affected areas. Transformations can take any of three basic forms: <ul><li><i>Chemical</i>: The target's chemical makeup is changed to other chemicals. <li><i>Physiological</i>: The target's basic life functions are changed. The target may be changed to animal, plant, or a different chemical basis. <li><i>Energy</i>: The solid target is converted to a coherent energy field.</ul> When creating the hero, the player decides the form of change in which the hero specializes. If random generation provides this Power again, the player can select another form or add +1CS to the first form chosen. Since this can be considered an attack, the target can choose to resist; he can also forego resistance if he so desires.

For example, the Purple Man broadcasts only the emotion of loyalty. Range and duration are determined by the Power rank. The Power affects everyone within its range. This Power is an excellent choice when the hero is facing adversaries more numerous and powerful than he is.

The spirit is permanently bonded to the new body for as long as that body lives, unless the bond is deliberately broken by the spirit (a red Psyche FEAT) or by a hero with Exorcism Power (L5). The hero can indefinitely hold the spirit in stasis (one Typical Intensity FEAT per day should be sufficient) while seeking a suitable body into which he can transplant the soul. If the hero fails a FEAT, he has 10 turns in which to implant the spirit or lose it forever. The hero cannot transplant the spirit into a living, intelligent being-with two notable exceptions. As noted earlier, spirits can be placed within newborn infants. The hero can also accept the spirit into himself; the result is the hero now has a complete second person living in his head. The player now has to redo his character sheet to reflect the secondary set of characteristics for Reason, Intuition, and Psyche. When a character is reincarnated into a body, he retains his abilities of Reason, Intuition, and Psyche, and any Mental Talents and Powers. Physical abilities, secondary characteristics, Physical Powers and Talents, and Contacts are all lost. Contacts can be quickly regained by convincing the Contacts of who he really is (a Remarkable Intensity FEAT). Karma awards should depend on how well the hero has handled the spiritual transplant.

This Power permits the character to perform acts beyond 20thcentury medical science (like brain transplants). If two or more brains are combined, the resulting character shows traits of both.

Symptoms appear 1-10 turns later. Curiously, victims are not themselves contagious to others. Obviously the Power alters the genetics of the diseasecausing organisms and weakens them so that they can only survive within the hero and the first new body into which they are introduced. Upon the death of the victim or the end of the Power's duration, all the microbes die as well. This Power does have a beneficial side. Because of the hero's special ability to control microbas, he can actually cure others of disease. By means of a red FEAT, the hero can draw out of the target's body every last microbe of a particular type. Note: This inly removes the cause of damage. It does not remove the effects of the disease. Example: Black Plague has a fondness for red-haired children, and cures a copper-haired tyke of smallpox. While the child will live, he still has the pockmarks. A character with this Power has to gain diseases, much as others would gain weapons, as he progresses. New characters begin with diseases common to everyday life, like chicken pox, mumps, influenza, and such. The character must actively seek out sources of new diseases in order to add them to his inner armory. This is done by consuming live cultures (\"I don't get it! Why would anyone drink a vial of smallpox culture?\") or by curing a diseased person in the manner explained earlier.

This is why only non-sentient or nonliving items can be used. While sentient Robots and Computers cannot be Enchanted, mindless servomechanisms can be. The mechanical components of a Cyborg may fall into this category; the Judge is free to decide on an individual basis. If he decides so, the Enchantment does not directly affect the living sections of the Cyborg. Enchantment can be prevented by a variety of factors. Interrupting the Mechanism that creates this Effect will prevent Enchantment from occurring at all. Removing the target causes the Mage to Enchant the now-empty air; if the inter. loper substitutes another item before the Mechanism is complete, then that item will get Enchanted instead. A would-be target can be protected from unwanted Enchantment by Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, Magic Control, Magic Domination, or a previously created Ward. When the Mage Enchants the item, he must specify the stimulus that will release the Magic. This can be a specific time, event, condition, intended target, or have a controlled release at the will of whoever is in possession of the Enchanted item. This last example includes such things as magical amulets, swords, wands, and the rest of the exotic paraphernalia that clutters the Swordand- Sorcery genre. Such an item reverts to normal when all the spells have been released. Some spells are permanent modifications. These are spells that only directly affect the item itself and not a second, external target later on. The innate Powers of a permanently Enchanted item can be resisted or even negated by such Powers as Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, Iron Will, Magic Control, or Magic Domination.

        MagicalEnergySource(PowerClass.Magic, "Magical Energy Source", 1, 0.07, "<b>Energy Source</b>: The Mage draws his Magic from a special source that provides him with all the raw Power he needs. As long as the Mage can maintain his link with his Source, he can continue to use the Magic it provides. The nature of the Source and the link vary by individual case. If the source is small enough, the Mage might be required to carry it with him. If not, perhaps the Mage has to simply return to the Source at regular intervals or forge a mystical \"silver cord\" that ties him to the Source, regardless of the intervening distance. The Judge ana player should work together to develop a playable Source and link. If the link is severed or the Source destroyed, the Mage is left with a finite supply of Magic. The amount of raw Magic he has left is the number of points equal to his Psyche rank. Each spell he casts depletes that reservoir by the Effects rank number. Obviously, it is in the Mage's best interests to renew his link or repair the Source as quickly as possible. Example: Rolthes the Wizard draws his Power from a glowing Orb he keeps in his Iowa City apartment. Holding the Orb at dawn renews his Power for another day. Tuesday night the Orb got stolen. Rolthes has Excellent Psyche and thus retains a reservoir of 20 points woith of Magic. (\"Why couldn't it have been stolen after I went to work?” he mutters.) He has enough Magic left for ten Feeble, five Poor, three Typical, two Good, cr one Excellent spell. He casts a Typical Telelocation spell with a range of 250 miles. It costs him six points, but at least he knows the Orb is in a truck in Grinnell only fifty miles away. Fourteen points are left. Rolthes expends another six in a Typical Teleportation spell into the truck, which leaves him with eight points worth of Magic with which to Mind Control the thief and reclaim the Orb. As you are beginning to suspect, this isn't really a Power but is more like a restraint. Take heart, because it is also a freebie.

        InternalLimbo(PowerClass.Magic, "Internal Limbo", 1, 0.02, "<b>Internal Limbo</b>: The Mage can create a pocket dimension whose gateway is his own body. This is a timeless space of near-infinite volume. The Mage can shape conditions within the Internal Limbo and create any environment he desires. For example, the world inside Adarn Warlock's Soul Gem is a rather pleasant park. The Mage can also control the basic attitudes and emotions of any being within this Limbo. Within the Soul Gem, to continue the example, everyone feels peace and happiness, even if they were vicious, violent people in the outside world. Conversely, a Mage might modify his particular Internal Limbo to terrify anyone he draws into it. The motion-altering aspect of Internal Limbo functions as +6CS Emotion Control. While the full size of anyone's Internal Limbo is difficult to measure, certain nitpicking players might want to know how much they can cram into theirs. The size of this pocket dimension is the equivalent of a cube measuring on one side the number of miles equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Typical rank can produce a cube six miles on a side (216 cubic miles). The Mage can alter the shape of this cube anyway he wants. That cube could be shaped into a flat tile 14 miles square or a ten foot high, ten foot wide corridor that extends for 11,395 miles. The real limit to how much the Mage can cram into his little world is the size of the Gateway that everything must pass through. The Gateway in this case is the Mage's body or rather a circle the diameter of his body. It is in a plane with the body and arms outstretched. It generally faces forward; that is, something has to be in front of the Mage in order for him to draw it in. The size of the Gateway can be decreased any amount and even pinched shut temporarily. Giant beings might limit their gateway to, say, their mouth or the palm of a hand. A target can Resist being draw in by the Gateway by using Strength, Agility, or any Travel Power. This Power's rank determines what Intensity of Strength FEAT. A moving target requires the Mage to make an Agility FEAT to catch the target. If the Mage tries to draw in a target larger than himself, odd things can happen. One, he might draw in only a section of it; the rest would appear to be sticking out of his body. This could be fatal and quite messy if some factor were to suddenly negate this Power. Two, he might be able to break off what parts of it would fit within the Gateway. This requires a Power FEAT based on the Material Strength of the target. Such broken materials are rejoined once the enter the Internal Limbo. Three, it simply might not work. The Mage would stick the target to his chest but that's as far as it would go. The only thing that is guaranteed to never be able to enter a Mage's Internal Limbo is the Mage's own physical body. If the Mage possesses such Powers as Energy Doppelganger, Illusory Duplication, Lifeform Creation, Free Spirit, Anatomical Separation, Self- Duplication, or Astral Body, then he can send a part or a representation of himself into his little world while the rest of himself stays in the outer world. Without such an ability, the Mage is limited to only basic awareness of conditions within the Internal Limbo. To conclude the example, Adam Warlock had no idea at all of what conditions were like within the Soul Gem until he physically died and was drawn in.

The Mage can control the actions of any Magic within his range and capabilities. If the Magic is free of a living Mage's body, the Power rank of that Magic determines what Intensity FEAT is required. For example, a Typical Controller needs to make a red FEAT to control a Good rank. If the Magic is internalized within another living Mage, the necessary FEAT is determined by the other Mage's Psyche. For example, a Monstrous rank is required to even think about manipulating Dr. Strange's magic. If Control is achieved, it affects the entire rank of that Magic. The range at which a Mage can Control Magic is determined by his own Power rank. Distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The Power can be made to affect either a specific type of spell or all the spells of specific Mage. In the first case, Control is exerted over all spells of the chosen type within the Mage's range, regardless of how many other Mages are affected. For example, the Mage might negate all Flying spells wfthin a certain area.In the second case, Control is exerted over a particular Magical adversary and affects all the spells that Mage possesses. For example, the archsorceress Jen'tmril reduces Rolthes' Spells to Feeble level. The duration of the Control lasts a maximum number of minutes equal to the Power rank number. After the expiration of that Control, it must be renewed. This can be done indefinitely. The range at which Control can be exerted is determined by the Power rank; appropriate distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table. Control is directed in a straight line; it is not automatically an area effect. If the Mage desires an area effect, the sphere he creates has a radius equal to -4CS range. For example, Excellent Control can be exerted over a six-area range or surround the Mage with a field that surrounds only his body. There are three forms of Magic Control. When creating the Mage, the player can choose any single form at full Power rank. Additional forms can be gained by decreasing all Control ranks by -1CS for each additional form. The player can select forms himself or let the dice do it. <table><tr><td>Die Roll</td><td>Form</td></tr><tr><td>01-40</td><td>Manipulation</td></tr><tr><td>41-70</td><td>Magnification/Reduction</td></tr><tr><td>71-00</td><td>Negation</td></tr></table> Manipulation—The Mage can alter the flow and application of Magic. He can change the direction of a cast spell's energies with a green Power FEAT. He can alter the effects of a spell by a yellow FEAT. He can completely change the nature of the spell by a red FEAT. For example, Rolthes casts a Feeble Fire Generation at Jen'tmril; she Manipulates the flames into a spray of rose petals. The Mage need not actually possess the new spell the old one was Manipulated into, but the new spell must be something harmless to either combatant. Magnification/Reduction—The Mage can either increase or decrease the rank of the affected Magic by his own Power rank number. For example, by means of a red FEAT and Remarkable Control, a Mage could change an Incredible spell to either Good or Monstrous rank. Unfortunately, the one thing the Mage cannot affect is his own Magic. Negation—This is an extreme form of Reduction. The Mage can completely dispel any Magic within his scope. Spells completely dissipate. Things affected by the dispelled Magic revert to their original condition. Mages are reduced to Normal Humans (or whatever). The worst effect is on Magical Creatures. The loss of Magic may be damaging or even fatal to such beings. Undesired Control can be avoided by Dodging a directed attack, moving out of the Control's range, or by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, and this Magical Power. Successful resistance enables the would be target to retain his normal Magic, at least for now. The Nemesis is an opposing or higher ranked form of Magic Control."),

This number always includes those Powers the Mage already possesses.

The Magical Powers she confers are nowhere near as high ranked as those the Mage possesses. New Magic is initially ranked at -3CS of this Power's rank. This can later be improved by the actions of the recipient. How long th e recipient retains the Power is determined by the Mage's Reason; it is a measure of how well he taught the recipient.

The normal ranges for Dominating a single being are shown on column A of the Range Table. Each additional being the Mage controls causes the range to decrease -1CS.

For example, Jen’tmril has Excellent Levitation. By transferring a Good rank of it into her aide Eleanor, she reduces her own rank to Good. The Mage can transfer a single Power with each spell. Because suddenly gaining Magical Power is usually in the recipient's best interests, Resistance is not usually attempted. The recipient is usually trying to cooperate instead. If Resistance is called for, unwanted Transferral can be thwarted by such things as moving the target out of range, disrupting the spell's mechanism as it is being cast, or blocking it with such Powers as Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, or Magic Control.

The Mage-Vampire can force a nonliving, non-sentient Magical item or being to release all its raw Magic. He must make a FEAT whose Intensity is equal to the highest ranked Magic the target possesses. For example, draining the Magic from Silver Dagger's namesake weapon requires an Amazing Intensity FEAT. A drained item is now nothing but a collection of normal materials. Magical beings may be hurt or destroyed if the Magic was an intrinsic part of their physiology. If not, they are now normal, powerless creatures. Living or sentient beings are harder to drain because they possess a Psyche. The would-be victim's Psyche determines what Intensity FEAT is required. A successful FEAT enables the Mage to drain Magic from the victim. An amount of raw Magic equal to this Power's rank number is drawn in equal amounts from all the victim's Magical Powers and any Magic that forms his physical body. The last applies if the victim is something other than human, such as a Golem. The process of feeding can continue indefinitely, as long as the Mage-Vampire continues to make successful FEATs. Each turn drains another rank's worth of Magic. The Mage-Vampire can voluntarily cease feeding at any time by making a Psyche FEAT of any color except red. A red FEAT means the Mage-Vampire's hunger is beyond his control. He has entered a feeding frenzy that will only cease when the target has been completely drained of Magic. If the Mage-Vampire fails to make any FEAT during the feeding process, he must break off his attack and cannot reestablish it. The victim instantly develops an immunity to that particular MageVampire and cannot be subjected to any future Attaoks by him. This immunity does not protect him from other Mage Vampires. The Magic that the Mage-Vampire absorbs is used to increase his Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any other Magic or Powers he possesses. The increase is in equal amounts to all the adjusted Abilities. The only Magic or Powers that cannot be increased is this Magical Vampirism itself. Example: Darkhound is an Excellent Mage-Vampire but possesses Feeble Strength, Poor Endurance, Good Psyche, and two Powers of Remarkable rank. His intended victim is Sytanceas, a demihuman Mage with three Magical Powers (Remarkable Sympathetic Magic, Feeble Internal Limbo, and Typical Gateway) and an Excellent Psyche. Darkhound makes the necessary yellow FEAT to begin feeding. He drains twenty points worth of Magic from Sytanceas. The loss of six points each wipes out the Internal Limbo and Gateway spells and reduces the third Magical Power lin EY, cellent rank. Darkhound adds five points, to each of his relevant Abilities; he now has Typical Strength, Good Endurance, Excellent Psyche, and two Incredible Powers. In the next turn, trouble strikes when Darkhound's player rolls a 51. Instantly a shock runs through Darkwolf and repulses him from his prey. The shaken Sytanceas looks first at the fleeing and then at the hank of fur he'd grabbed from his attacker… Why do Mage-Vampires do it? Due to their peculiar nature, they lose energy at a disturbing rate. The rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any Magic or Powers (except this one) drop one point per hour. The Mage-Vampire must feed to return things to their original levels. A Mage-Vampire cannot actually starve if denied victims, but when all his affected rank numbers reach Shift-0, he enters a death-like trance. His Magical Vampirism continues to seek victims and can attempt to drain anything Magical that comes in contact with the body. When the Mage-Vampire's Abilities return to Feeble rank, he returns to life. When creating the Mage-Vampire, the player must play his Weakness (you cannot ignore it like many of your fellow players do theirs). The player can increase the Power rank by +1CS for each additional Weakness he takes, up to a maxim,um of three additional Weaknesses. Magical Vampirism is communicable.

There are four forms of this Power, each with a specific area of effect. Three of these alter the conditions that result from the passage of time. The fourth alters the actual flow of time.

The event can have any degree of importance, from a simple coin toss to the passage of the Mutant Control Act. Events of greater importance require the Mage to make the desired change in a series of several steps over a great period of time. The Power is limited to directly influencing events within a finite range of time and complexity. The maximum range into the future that the Mage can directly influence events is the number of turns equal to her Power rank number. For example, an Excellent rank can influence an event that won't occur for another twenty turns. The complexity of the desired change decides what Intensity FEAT is required. Random chance or a single event that is decided by the dice requires a green FEAT to change to the Mage's whim. Series of physical actions or altering a person's decisions requires a yellow FEAT. Altering several conscious decisions by two or more people requires a red FEAT. The Mage must be within line-of-sight of the location of the impending event in order to use this Power. Clairvoyance or Sensory Link can be coupled with this Power to extend its range up to the limit of that Puwer's detection range. This Power requires a great deal of cooperation with the Judge, especially at the higher levels that have an immediate range of several minutes or hours of game time. If the FEAT is successful, the future event occurs naturally at the appointed time. If the FEAT is unsuccessful, the event is somehow protected from the Mage's tampering. She must try a different tactic if she makes another attempt to alter that future event. Example: Tamper has Remarkable Reality Alteration and a range of three minutes. She is incognito at a secret Congressional Appropriations Committee meeting at which Henry Peter Gyrich is seeking funding for additional Sentinels. Tamper is trying to cut the funding. As this requires changing the minds of several Congressmen, a red FEAT is required. Two minutes before the vote is taken, she tries and fails (her player rolled a 66). The Congressmen's minds are already made up. She tries another tactic by concentrating on Gyrich himself. She increases the probability that he would do something incredibly obnoxious that would disgrace him in front of the Congressmen. This only alters a single mind and is a yellow FEAT. She fails that too (he's too hidebound). Finally she concentrates on making the fire sprinkler system fail (a green FEAT). She succeeds, the room gets drenched, and the Committee adjourns before actually taking the vote. Tamper has another day to figure out some way to succeed. Some events appear to be too complex for this Power. In such a case, the Mage should remember the adage, \"From little acorns grow mighty oaks.\" A little timetampering today can snowball into a major rewrite of history in years to come. Alter Present—The Mage can change the conditions of her present surroundings. It is as if the Mage had somehow altered the past without realizing it. In truth, the Mage has built a pocket dimension that transformed her immediate surroundings into those of a world from an alternate timeline. The world she uses is one whose natural conditions most closely matches the desired conditions. The degree of difference between the real and the borrowed world determines what Intensity FEAT is required. A world that fairly closely matches that of the Marvel Universe requires a green FEAT. A world of major historical differences but similar in biological and geological terms requires a yellow FEAT. Worlds that are drastically different, such as a New York built by intelligent lizards, require a red FEAT. The Mage can take any number of people along to this other-world. The maximum number is equal to the Power rank number. Anyone consciously brought along retains their original minds and memories of conditions in their native reality. Such passengers can operate freely anywhere within the Mage's area of control. A size of the affected region is a spherical area whose size is determined by the Power rank. The radius is the number of miles equal to the Power rank number. A curious side-effect of this Power is that the affected area can be used as a gateway to the other-world it emulates. Anyone traveling beyond the range of the Mage's Power is automatically transported to that real world. Fortunately they retain a link to the Mage that allows them to automatically return if they again enter the area represented by the Mage's Power. This assumes they return while the Mage's little world still exists; if they tarry too long they become accidental emigres to this other-world and will have to find their own way home. The actual lifespan of the pocket dimension is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time of creation. A green Reason FEAT gives a maximum duration of two hours times the Reason rank number. A yellow Feat increases it to one day times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT increases that to ten days times the Reason rank number. In very special circumstances, the Mage might be able to make the duration permanent. In such a case, the pocket dimension has expanded to take in all of the emulated other-world. Such cases are entirely at the Judge's discretion and should be limited to extremely urgent rewritings of campaign history. An example of this might be if Fabian Stankowitz had accidentally killed all the Avengers in the last gaming session. The Mage can terminate the pocket dimension at any time, thereby returning everyone to the real world. Their locations upon returning correspond to their relative positions in the other-world. If their earlier positions had been at an altitude or depth other than ground level, upon returning they are safely deposited on a surface that most resembles their earlier position. If none is available, they are deposited at ground level. Alter Past—The Mage can actually change past history and thereby really alter the present. This is the most powerful listing in the Ultimate Powers Book. As such, it will probably be forbidden to player characters except in the rarest of cases. The range at which the Mage can reach into past is determined by the Power rank. The Mage must be at the site of any past event he wants to change. His Power rank decreases -1CS for each mile it is away from the actual site. The maximum temporal range is the number of weeks equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Shift-Y rank can reach nearly four years into the past. The difficulty of the desired change determines what Intensity rank is required. Single physical events, such as anything determined by a single die roll, can be changed by a green FEAT. Complex or sequential physical events or altering a single being's behavior requires a yellow FEAT. Altering the behavior of two or more beings requires a red FEAT. The reason most Judges will forbid their players to have this Power is that it requires them to rethink. the history of their Marvel campaign in terms of this alteration. Take heart in the cynical knowledge that most people's actions do not significantly alter the fabric of history. As a rule of thumb concerning common people, there is only a one-in-athousand chance that one person's changed decision will have a significant effect on history. When dealing with influential people (leaders, super beings, creative types, and so on), the probability rises to one-in-ten. Note: There is much debate over the true nature of tampering with the past. Is there a single timeline that is irreparably changed by each act of tampering? Are there infinite worlds and thus tampering is not only allowed but encouraged? Does the act of tampering actually catapult the tamperer into an alternate world of her own devising? The game mechanics support the last interpretation. Each Judge's Marvel campaign is set in an alternate world that more or less mirrors the published accounts of the Marvel Universe (the comic books, people). Extensive tampering in the past affects only the world of the tamperer and her player. Judges can even play several alternate timelines, switching among them at each gaming session. Alter Temporal Flow—The Mage can alter the rate at which time passes. He can accelerate or decelerate it to such a point that the affected area is apparently in stasis. The maximum amount that time is altered is proportional to the Power rank number. Time is accelerated by its normal rate times the Power rank number. For example, a Good rank can make time pass at tenfold speed. Deceleration makes time apparently pass at arate equal to the normal rate divided by the Power rank number. For example, a Monstrous rate can stretch one minute into 75 minutes. The perception of time's passage depends on who is actually accelerated or decelerated. To an accelerated person, the world has slowed down. To a decelerated person, time has sped up. Clever Mages can really screw people up by playing on this. For example, decelerating everyone around a certain person might make that person believe that he had actually been accelerated. The Power may be used to alter either the Mage or another target. If it is used against another, that target is allowed to resist. Such means include Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, and Time Travel. The Power can be developed into a Variety of Power stunts. Optional Powers include Precognition for Alter Future, Clairvoyance for Alter Present, and Retrocognition for Alter Past.

The amount drained per turn is equal to'this Power's rank number. The Vampire can drain this amount each turn that he makes a successful FEAT. He can voluntarily stop feeding at any point by making a Psyche FEAT of any color except red. A red FEAT means his hunger is beyond his control. He has entered a feeding frenzy that cannot stop until the victim's Psyche and Intuition are completely drained or the Vampire has been repulsed. If the Vampire fails to make a FEAT at any stage in the feeding process, he is instantly repulsed from the victim. He can never re-establish his attack because the victim develops an instant immunity to any Vampiric attack from that specific Vampire. The victim can be the target of attacks by other Vampires later on. The drained energy is added in equal amounts to the Vampire's Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and any Powers the Vampire has. The exception is this Power; no Vampiric Power can ever be increased by the Vampire himself. Example: Madame Arcania is a Good Clairvoyant and Incredible Vampire. She has Feeble Strength and Endurance and Incredible Psyche. She normally feeds on the customers who come to her Tea Room on the East Side. Today she gets a surprise, as her target is a disguised Mesmero, who possesses Typical Intuition and Amazing Psyche, among his other Abilities. Madame Arcania is surprised to discover she must make a red FEAT to initiate the attack but she feels up to the challenge. She makes her first FEAT under the pretense of reading his palm. Mesmero's Intuition immediately drops to zero and his Psyche drops the remaining 34 points to Typical. Arcania's abilities and Powers all rise 10 points; she now has Good Strength, Good Endurance, Amazing Psyche, and Excellent Clairvoyance. Normally she makes only a single feeding attack on her victims and she decides to stop feeding. Her player makes a Psyche FEAT to see if she can quit. Unfortunately, he's rolling the dice too well; he makes a red FEAT. For Madame Arcania, the feast is too much to resist. She makes a green Power FEAT (based on the Mesmero's now- Typical Psyche) and drains the remaining six points. Mesmero's Psyche is now at Shift-0 and he collapses. Madame Arcania summons her servant to dispose of the debris. Spirit Vampires lose energy at a dreadful rate. Their rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and all their Powers except this one drop one point per hour. The Spirit Vampire must feed in order to bring these back to at least their original levels. Even if deprived of victims, a Spirit Varnpire will not starve to death. When all his atfected Abilities and Powers reach Shift-0. he enters a death-like trance. His vampirism continues to function and will try to drain anyone who comes in contact with him. When the Vampire's Abilities return to Feeble, he regains consciousness. When creating a Vampire, the player must select and use a weakness. He can increase the Power rank by +1CS for each additional Weakness he chooses, up to a maximum of four weaknesses in all. Spirit Vampirism is communicable. A victim who was completely drained as a result of a feeding frenzy must make a mandatory Psyche FEAT roll. A red FEAT transforms the victim into a Feeble Spirit Vampire. Example: A street punk named Raoul spots Mesmero lying in an alley. Raoul decides to strip the body of any valuables. As soon as he touches the body, Mesmero's new Vampirism lashes out at Raoul and begins to feed. Spirit Vampires can be repelled by such Powers as Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, and Magic Control. The Optional Power is concurrent BioVampirism. The Nemesis is an enhanced Psyche."){

Sympathetic Magic requires the Mage make an Effigy of his target as a way of directing the Power to that target. The Effigy can be of any quality of workmanship, from a crude wax doll to an exquisitely detailed full portrait in oil paints; however, the Effigy must incorporate a cast-off body part, excretion, or possession of the target. The most common example is a hank of hair. Once the Effigy is created, any action that affects that Effigy will also affect the target. Physical manipulation of the Effigy causes a similar effect on the target. For example, sticking a pin into a wax doll would cause sudden stabbing pains in the target. The effigy can be used as a focal point for Mental powers; the Voodoo Mage concentrates on the Effigy as if it were the target. Of course, the wouldbe victim can resist this Magical attack using his Psyche. Sympathetic Magic incorporates forms of the following Powers, which function at Power rank but are limited to a single target: <ul><li>Life, Magic, Power, Psionic, and Weakness Detections; <li>Biophysical Control, Emotion Control, Hypnotic Control, Mind Control, Shapechange Others, Sleep—Induced, and Summoning; and <li>Communicate with Animals, Empathy, Hallucinations, Remote Sensing, and Telepathy.</ul> If the Mage possesses other Powers, these should be incorporated into this Magic to give the Mage further forms of Voodoo spells. Once the Effigy is made, it can be used over and over again to effect the target. Its Power over the target can only be broken by removing the material that provides the physical link to him. Once the victim. knows the existence of the Effigy, he should do anything in his Power to find it and remove the linking material. The range at which the Voodoo can affect a target is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate distances are shown on Column B of the Range Table. The Voodoo can only actively affect a single target at any one time because of the simple constraint that all the Voodoo Mage's hands and concentration are need to perform the Magic. Effigies can affect any living or sentient being. Sympathetic Magic can be used against Robots, Computers, Cyborgs, rock-men, gas-women, and so on, provided the rules are followed. (Making an Effigy of an Ethereal would be kind of tricky though.) The Nemesis for this Power is Iron Will."),
        Warding(PowerClass.Magic, "Warding", 1, 0.05, "<b>Warding</b>: The Mage can create areas of latent Power in any desired location. The Ward is designated by a special substance or mark. The mage decides what specific Powers the Ward possesses and what the triggering stimulus will be. When that stimulus occurs, the Ward releases all its power is a single turn, generally in the direction of whatever created the stimulus. The Power's rank determines how great a variety of Wards the Mage can create. The rank number is also the number of Powers he can incorporate into his Wards, even if the Mage cannot directly use those Powers. hirrn-self. Each Wards's intensity rank is the same as the Mage's own rank. For example, a Mage with Excellent Warding can create 20 different Wards, each possessing Excellent Intensity rank. A Remarkable Intensity FEAT enables the Mage to create a single-use Ward. An Amazing Intensity FEAT enables him to create a self-renewing Ward. The Power rank number is also the maximum number of Wards a Mage can have in existence at any one time. If the Mage tries to surpass this number, his oldest still-existing Ward harmlessly vanishes. The minimum distance between Wards is one foot for each point of the Wards' combined Intensity rank numbers. For example, a Feeble and a Monstrous Ward must be separated by at least 77 feet.If the Mage attempts to place a new ward within range of an existing one, the new one will not function. If the new Ward's area of effect would overlap with another Ward, the new Ward cannot have the full Intensity rank. The new Ward will have a maximum rank that will only touch the edge of the earlier Ward's range. For example, a Good Ward coyers an area of ten-foot radius.If the Mage tries to create a Remarkable Ward within twenty feet of the Good Ward, lie discovers he can only create a Good ward at best. If he backs off another twenty feet, though, he can create the Intensity he desires. The triggering mechanism can be any condition stated by the Mage at the time of creation. Normally Wards are. triggered by the close passage of a living being. Thus they are often found near doorways or in passages. Once created, Wards last until they are depleted or destroyed. Given the durability of modern building materials, a Ward can last for about a century or so. (Quick, name five 100-year-old buildings in your area!) Wards can be destroyed by demolishing the surface on which they are placed or by the use of Magic Control/ Negation. Wards can be detected by a number of ways. The simplest is the brute force method of triggering them (also called the really stupid method). The presence of a Ward can be revealed by either Energy, Magic, Power, or Psionic Detection. Shortly after the Mage has been created, the Player should make up a list of at half of the possible Wards he can create. The Player should return to the Power Generation tables on pages 14-16 and randomly generate all the Powers the Mage can incorporate into Wards. Wards that employ a special variation on normal Power use, such as a Power Stunt, should be treated as individual Wards. Example: Consider two different Wards that each employ Force Field Generation. One creates a trap that envelops anyone within the target area. The other one creates an invisible column of force that shoves anyone back with rank level Strength. Each of these is considered a separate Ward and requires a unique designation. Nemesis Powers include Energy, Magic, Psionic, and Power Detections and Resistance to Magic."),

        //Matter Control
        Bonding(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Bonding", 1, 0.05, "<b>Bonding</b>: The hero has the ability to join two or more targets together on a molecular level. The effect is the same as if the targets were glued or welded together. In actuality, the hero has induced molecular adhesion. A submicroscopic examination would fail to reveal any foreign material (such as a glue) or disturbances in the normal arrangement of the target's structure (such as the distortion caused by welding). The Bonding is so powerful that attempting to sever its effect results in physical damage to either of the Bonded targets because the only way to forcibly separate two Bonded objects is to tear the surface of one or both of them. This causes Typical wounds to a living target. The range for Bonding is limited to Contact only. The hero need not touch the actual area to be Bonded, although the hero needs to touch the two targets somewhere in order to direct the Power's effect. Once the hero is touching both targets and has begun to manifest his Power, Bonding occurs at any point where the two targets are in contact with each other. The Bonding process takes any number of turns, depending both on the hero's Power rank and the desired material strength of the Bonding. The first turn produces a Bonding of Feeble material strength. Each turn the Bonding process continues raises that material strength +1CS, up to the limit of the Power rank. At any point the hero can cease to use his Power and thus produce Bondings of varied strengths. Example: K. Z. Glew has Good Bonding and is testing his Power on a number of blocks. When he holds two together for two turns, he produces a Poor Bonding. Holding two together for three turns produces a Typical Bonding. Holding two bricks for four turns produces a Good Bonding; in fact, K. Z. could concentrate on the same two bricks all day and not be able to exceed that Good Bonding. The duration of the Bonding is determined by a Power FEAT at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT creates a Bond that lasts a number of turns equal to the hero's Reason rank number times 100. A yellow FEAT increases the multipliers to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT ensures a permanent Bonding. If the Bonding is temporary, its effects end without a trace at the expiration of the time limit. This is a Power that readily combines with many of the other listings in this book. Combining it with Webcasting produces an equivalent to Spiderman's web. Weapons Tinkering produces an equivalent to the Trapster's glue gun. Chemical Touch produces a natural adhesive coating on the hero's body. Combustion or Fire Generation produces napalm. There are more but I'll leave them to the player's imagination to devise. The Power can only affect solids. Liquid, gaseous, ethereal, and Phasing matter are immune to this Power's effects. Once Bonded, matter cannot Phase as a means of escaping the adhesion; doing so causes Typical damage as the Bonded surface is lett behind. Transition from solid to either liquid or gaseous state will work to free the Bonded matter without physical damage, although this is not an option for most people. Bonding only occurs on the surface and does not penetrate more than 1/1 6th of an inch into any Bonded material. The effect this has on living targets is that only the epidermis is affected. As it does not affect liquids, the Power automatically penetrates any coating that might otherwise protect the target.

        Collection(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Collection", 1, 0.12, "<b>Collection</b>: The hero can cause any.desi red. material to collect in a specific location. This material must already be present and diffused throughout the hero's vicinity, whether in the air, water, soil, or scattered across the ground. The Collection area has a radius determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on column C of the Range Table inside this book’s cover. For example, an Incredible rank can collect material from as far as 25 miles away. Collected material instantly teleports to the designated Collection site. The site must be in line of sight of the hero and within his Power's range. The hero can Collect per turn a maximum amount of material measured in the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. This assumes, of course, that enough material exists within the vicinity in order to be Collected. Any material of any nature can be Collected. There is a partial exemption to this rule in regards to living beings. The Power can only Collect living beings whose weight is within the weight limits for the Power; if the beings weighs more, the Power can not affect them aside from a brief tug. If the Power is used to Collect the bodily products of living beings, player and Judges are to assume that so little is drawn from each being that no harm results. For example, a character could Collect a mass of blood without having to worry that he bled some stranger to death. The Power does not after the state of any matter either before or after Collection. The desired matter must be in the basic chemical formulation desired. Desired materials that are in some altered state are not affected by the Power. For example, trying to Collect steel in a junkyard full of rust will lead to naught. The exception is if the desired material is in either a state of solution or suspension, since neither actually affects the chemical nature of the material. For example, imagine your hero is standing at the seaside and practicing his Power. He cannot Collect the hydrogen bound into the water but he could Collect salt, gold, or anything else dissolved into seawater. Collecting salt is easy; a Remarkable Power can Collect a mansized pile within a minute's time. Gold is harder; each cubic mile of seawater contains only a few ounces of gold. Due to some unexplained limitation to this Power, it cannot randomly Collect foreign materials found within the bodies of anyone within the Power's range. Common foreign materials include tooth fillings, prostheses, sutures, and drugs. If the hero must Collect such materials from a body. For example if he knows arsenic has been swallowed by someone, the conditions increase in difficulty. The hero must be in contact with the source of the desired material and the hero must make a red FEAT to withdraw the material without harming the donor. Failure to do so means the material is still locked within the target's body. Ethereal and Phasing matter can be Collected. They just can't be held for any length of time without consciously and repeatedly using the Power to return such matter to the Collection site. This Power is most commonly linked to the Matter Control and Conversion Powers as a way to gather sufficient raw material to permit the other Powers to function. These are listed as Optional Powers. Even if used by itself, this Power can be used effectively. Matter can be Collected to form a protective shield or to entrap a foe in a suddenly appearing pile of debris. Dirt or water can be Collected to smother a fire or dampen escaping radiation. The hero is free to develop various Power Stunts using suddenly materialized matter. The complexity of the material to be collected determines what Intensity FEAT is required. Raw, amorphous materials can be collected in a dusty pile by a green FEAT. Common examples include metals, dirt, and water. Formed or complex material requires a yellow FEAT to collect in recognizable form. Examples include bricks, edibles, and comic books. Biological material requires a red FEAT, whether the hero is trying to collect bile or hamsters.

        Crystallization(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Crystallization", 1, 0.05, "<b>Crystallization</b>: The hero can transform any target material into a gemlike material that possesses Power rank material strength. Crystallization occurs because the hero has the ability to shape the molecular bonds of normally amorphous matter into a crystal matrix of great strength. The Crystallization can occur at any site within the hero's line of sight and range; distances are determined by the Power rank and can be found on column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The newlyformed Crystal is initially stationary; it cannot be launched like a missile (unless the hero possesses Missile Creation, but I'm getting ahead of myself). It can be formed in such a position that gravity immediately affects it. Crystallization automatically affects non-living, unprotected, stationary targets. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT in order to hit the target. If Crystallization is used as an attack against a living target, it can be resisted by the usual methods. Methods of protecting a target from being Crystallized include Force Field vs. Energy Attack, Resistance to Energy Attack, True Invulnerability, and various Magics and Power Controls. Crystal can be formed in any shape the hero desires. The amount of Crystal the hero can create in a single turn is the number of square feet equal to the Power rank number. The material to be transformed into Crystal is drawn from particles in the air or from the target itself. Solid targets can themselves be Crystallized. If the Power is used on a living target, innate safeguards incorporated into the Power place the target into a semi-state of Suspended Animation; all life functions temporarily cease but the target remains aware of its condition and surroundings. A Crystallized lifeform must remain intact if the process is to be reversed. If the Crystallized lifeform is shattered, the transformation is permanent. Note: the shards-of a shattered, Crystallized lifeform all possess some of the victim's lifeforce; the percentage of the victim's Psyche possessed by a particular shard is equal to the percentage of the original body represented by the shard. Such shards can be used to create powerful Magic. Such shards can also lead to later Plot Complications. (\"You don't understand. The gem in the necklace I gave Helen was part of Leviathan!\") Normally Crystallization is only temporary. The duration of a given Crystal is the number of minutes equal to the Power rank number. At the expiration of this time, the Crystal reverts back to its original material. If the Crystallization was directed in the air the original material was probably dust particles. As mentioned earlier, if the Crystallization was used to transform a living target and that Crystal was subsequently shattered, the transformation is made permanent. (This rule is purposefully intended to spare the Judge and players from dealing with the hamburger that would be created if the formerly living target did revert to its original state.) For game purposes, the category of \"living target\" can be expanded by the Judge to encompass any of the Physical Types for player characters and NPCs. The Power can be combined with other Powers listed in this book. As mentioned before, Missiles can give the Crystals momentum and range. Weapons Creation can specialize in crystalline instruments of destruction. Body Armor or Body Coating can be a suit of flexible crystalline armor with that gives Power rank Resistance to physical or energy attacks. Vision-based Detection Powers can be achieved by the hero spontaneously forming optical devices and lenses of crystal. If the hero has an exotic Physical Type, perhaps he can himself be composed of living crystal. Such categories include Modified Humans, Cyborgs, Robots, Abnormal Chemistry, Mineral, Compound, and Changeling.

In such a case, the would-be target is assumed to already be Diminished to a further point than the hero could reach anyway. The level to which the hero can Diminish a target is determined by the Power rank. Levels appropriate to this Power are: <table><tr><td colspan=2>Resultant Size</td></tr><tr><td>Rank</td><td>% of Original Size</td></tr><tr><td>FE</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>PR</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>TY</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>GD</td><td>6.25%</td></tr><tr><td>EX</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>RE</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>IN</td><td>.5%</td></tr><tr><td>AM</td><td>.25%</td></tr><tr><td>MN</td><td>.1%</td></tr><tr><td>UN</td><td>.01%</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>.001%</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>.00001%</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>.0000001%</td></tr><tr><td>CL1000</td><td>.00000000001%</td></tr><tr><td>CL3000</td><td>.00000000000000001%</td></tr><tr><td>CL5000</td><td>.000000000000000000000000000000001%</td></tr></table> In practical terms, a Diminishment rank of Shift X, Y, or Z is sufficient to reduce a normal-sized human to the size of a cell. Either CL1000 or CL3000 will reduce him to atomic scale. CL5000 reduces a human to such a point where he can enter a Microverse such as Jarella's world of Kaa. A note on Microverses: These are miniature dimensions that can be reached by a person undergoing extreme size reduction. The act of Shrinking causes the person to breach the Dimensional Barriers and reach a chosen Microverse. The worlds within a Microverse roughly correspond to but are not actually atoms or molecules. Once within a Microverse, the Dimension traveler finds himself in an environment that approximates conditions in the larger, outer world. Microverses may themselves contain even smaller Microverses. Even our own world may in fact be a Microverse to some inconceivably larger Macroverse. The duration of Diminution on a target is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used on the target. A green Reason FEAT gives a duration of the Reason rank number times 100 turns. A yellow FEAT increase this to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the diminution permanent; in such a case the only way the target can return to its original size is through use of Enlargement, Magic, or Power Negation. There are three very different ways to create the effect of Diminution. Each has its own mechanism and peculiar properties as a result of that mechanism. The player can either choose for himself or let a random die roll determine which form. Atomic Collapse—The hero decreases the distance between the target's atoms and subatomic particles. The target does not lose weight as it shrinks. Rather, it becomes increasingly dense and could eventually collapse into neutronium (CL3000 Diminution) or even a black hole (CL5000 Diminution). Strength is unaffected by the change in size but leverage becomes increasingly difficult at smaller sizes. Atomic Reduction—The hero decreases the number of atoms in the target's body. The lost matter is either disintegrated (if the Diminution is permanent) or temporarily removed from the target's plane of existence and stored on another plane until it is needed to return the target to its original size. Mass and strength both decrease as the target Shrinks; the lower ranks are proportional to the target's new size. The target becomes increasingly simple in structure and reach a stage where the remaining structure is too simple to sustain the lifeforce of a living target. This occurs at Shift X rank. If the Diminution is temporary, the target's lifeforce is stored on the same plane as the displaced matter that normally forms his body. At Shift Z Diminution, the target consists of only a single molecule which immediately vanishes when the next rank is reached. Atomic Reduction—This is the most common form of Diminution and the only form that permits the target to enter a Microverse. The hero can reduce the size of the atoms and subatomic particles themselves, thus reducing the overall size in a proportional manner. Mass and physical strength are reduced a proportional amount. While this Power has more advantages than the other forms, it has a deadly disadvantage. As the target's atoms shrink, they are no longer able to interact with other, normal sized atoms. As a result, a living target is unable to breathe the air or consume food or water. Seen in this light, this form of Diminution is the equivalent of a Fatal attack. Fortunately, there is a 95% chance the Power envelopes the target in an energy field that shrinks anything within one foot (proportional to the target's current size) of the target to the same size as the target. This allows the target to breathe, drink, and eat. The existence of this field is randomly determined at the time the source of the Diminution is created. If the hero lacks such field, then any target must have its own supply of proportionally-sized consumables. Even non-living targets can be affected in that the Power effectively insulates them from electricity, since normal-sized electrons cannot flow into a Diminished conductor. Treat this as rank level Resistance to Electricity. If the field exists, electrons are automatically Shrunken to permit conductivity. It is assumed that when the Power is used, the hero intends to Diminish the entire target. If the hero specifies, he can attempt to shrink only part of a target. Since this is equivalent to tearing the target apart, a Power FEAT determined by the Material Strength of the target is required to do such an act. Example: Sizemaster has possesses Remarkable Diminution. Seeing an uproar at his local bank, he wanders in to see what's up. He discovers The Shocker trying desperately to free people trapped in a safe and he decides to assist the rescue. He locates a section of the safe away from The Shocker and begins to manifest his Power. The safe is made of steel and reinforced concrete and has a Remarkable Material Strength. Good, Sizemaster only needs to make a yellow FEAT to Diminish a hatch in the safe's wall. Within twelve seconds he has Diminished a six-foot-wide area into a one-inch-wide plug, which drops out of the wall and rolls around on the floor. Sizemaster is helping the trapped people out of the safe when Shocker finally burns through the opposite wall. Later the two rivals seal the hole Sizemaster made by holding the plug in place as returned to its original size. The Power can automatically effect a non-living, stationary, unprotected target. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT to hit the target with his Power. Living targets are allowed to resist the Power's effects in the same way they would resist any energy attack Targets can be protected from Diminution by such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, and the simultaneous use of an opposing Enlargement Power. Atomic Dispersal opposes Atomic Collapse, Atomic Gain opposes Atomic Reduction, and Atomic Growth opposes Atomic Shrinkage. If the opponent lacks the matching form of Enlargement he can still try to negate the effects of Diminution with whatever form he possesses; the results can get a little weird, though.

        Disruption(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Disruption", 1, 0.10, "<b>Disruption</b>: The hero can destroy a target's physical structure without resorting to a physical or overt energy attack. The molecular bonds that give a target its solidity are directly Disrupted, with the result that the target collapses into dust, sand, liquid, or even vapor. The Material Strength of the target determines what Intensity FEAT is required. For example, asphalt has Good Material Strength and consequently would require a Good Intensity FEAT to destroy. The hero can Disrupt any target within both line-of-sight and range. The range is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The amount of matter the hero can Disrupt in a single turn is the number of pounds equal to his Power rank number. If the player chooses when creating the character, he can increase either range or amount affected any number of +CS by decreasing the other factor an equal number of -CS. Example: an initial rank of Good can be altered by up to 3CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (Contact only) and Incredible effect (40 pounds) or Incredible range (11 areas) and Feeble effect (two pounds). Also when creating the character, the player can choose whether to make the Disruption permanent or temporary. Choosing the temporary option raises the Power rank +1CS. The duration of the Disruption is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT gives a duration equal to 100 turns times the Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns time the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the Disruption permanent. At the expiration of the duration, the Disrupted matter reforms in its original shape although not necessarily in its original location.

A red FEAT makes the Enlargement permanent. There are three different mechanisms by which Enlargement can occur. Each form has a different set of innate properties. When creating the character, the player must decide which form the hero has. The player can either select one or let the dice randomly determine it for him. <table><tr><td>Die Roll</td><td>Form</td></tr><tr><td>01-30</td><td>Atomic Dispersal</td></tr><tr><td>31-60</td><td>Atomic Growth</td></tr><tr><td>61-00</td><td>Atomic Gain</td></tr></table> Atomic Dispersal—The Power causes the spaces between the atoms and subatomic particles to increase, thus increasing overall size. Mass remains the same despite any increase in size, causing the target's density to drop. Material Strength decreases -1CS with each doubling in size. Eventually, at Shift X Enlargement a solid target reaches a stage where it is less dense than air and can drift off. At Class 1000 rank and beyond, the target becomes effectively intangible to contact with normal matter. Atomic Gain—The Power causes the target to gain additional atoms. These are automatically incorporated into the target to duplicate and augment existing molecular structures. As the targets gains new atoms, the size and mass of the target increase proportionally. Where do the new atoms come from? There are three possibilities. One theory holds that Molecular Creation creates them from the hero's force of will. A second theory suggests Molecular and Elemental Conversion are responsible; the new atoms are simply Converted air molecules. The third explanation is that the hero somehow taps into another dimension, one that contains nothing but the raw material for this Power and the Matter Creation Powers and also provides a storage place for the matter displaced by Shrinking, Diminution, and Disintegration. This last idea could lead to a Plot Complication wherein the hero accidentally draws something More than raw material from that unknown dimension. I'll leave it to you to decide which explanation you accept as the truth. As the target expands, it gains real strength sufficient to move its new mass. Real strength increases +1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement the target is exposed to. Example: The Power is used on a normal adult six feet in height, 200 pounds in weight, and possessing Typical Strength. <table><tr><td>Enlargement Rank</td><td>Weight</td><td>Strength/Max. Lift</td></tr><tr><td>FE</td><td>300 lb.</td><td>TY/200 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>PR</td><td>400 lb.</td><td>GD/400 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>TY</td><td>600 lb.</td><td>GD/600 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>GD</td><td>800 lb.</td><td>EX/800 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>EX</td><td>1200 lb.</td><td>EX/1200</td></tr><tr><td>RE</td><td>1600 lb.</td><td>RE/2000</td></tr><tr><td>IN</td><td>2000 lb.</td><td>RE/4000</td></tr><tr><td>AM</td><td>2400 lb.</td><td>IN/3 tons</td></tr><tr><td>MN</td><td>3000 lb.</td><td>IN/10 tons</td></tr><tr><td>UN</td><td>2 tons</td><td>AM/25 tons</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>5 tons</td><td>AM/50 tons</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>10 tons</td><td>MN/65 tons</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>20 tons</td><td>MN/80 tons</td></tr><tr><td>CL1000</td><td>50 tons</td><td>UN/80 tons</td></tr><tr><td>CL3000</td><td>100 tons</td><td>UN/100 tons</td></tr><tr><td>CL5000</td><td>1000 tons</td><td>X/l000 tons</td></tr></table> The target's other Primary and Secondary Abilities remain unaffected. The disadvantages of great size negate the advantages. However, Health seems to increase because physical attacks do less relative damage. For example, a single bullet could kill a normal sized person but would be little more than a high-velocity grain of sand to a giant. The damage done by Physical Attacks decreases -1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement. Note: the damage that didn't affect the giant might be fatal when he reverts to normal size. Wounds shrink but bullets do not. Atomic Growth—The target's atoms and subatomic particles actually increase in size, thus increasing the target's overall size. Mass increases proportionally. The target's Strength increases only enough to match his greater weight; Lifting Strength does not increase. There is a dangerous drawback to this form of Enlargement. As the target's atoms grow, they become unable to interact with normal atoms. The result is that the target is unable to breathe, drink, or eat. Fortunately there is a 95% chance that the Power envelops the target in an energy field that enlarges any atoms within its effect to the same scale as the target. The existence of this field must be determined at the time the hero is created. If the field is not present, the target must have a proportionallysized supply of consumables or this Power is considered a Fatal attack. The lack of the field has one advantage in that Electricity cannot flow between normalsized and Enlarged conductors. The Power thus provides rank level Resistance to Electricity. It is always assumed that the hero intends to Enlarge the entire target's body. If the hero intends to Enlarge a specific area of a target, he must make a special effort to do so. Since this has the effect of tearing the target apart, the hero must make a Power FEAT based on the Material Strength of the target. For example, a brick wall has Good Material Strength. A hero with Typical Enlargement would need to make a red FEAT to enlarge a specific section of the wall, while a hero with an Incredible rank would only have to make a green FEAT. The effects -on the entire target if only a section of it is Enlarged vary by case and by degree of Enlargement. The most common result of a section of Enlarged matter surrounded by normal matter is that one of the two sections shattered, depending on which is the weaker section. Atomic Dispersal weakens Material Strength, Atomic Growth doesn't alter it, and Atomic Gain increases it. Judges should use this guide and their imagination to decide the results of specific Enlargement. The Power automatically affects stationary, non-living, unprotected targets. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power just as they could any Energy Attack. Targets can be protected from Enlargement by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, Certain Magics and Power Controls, and any of the Shrinking or Diminution Powers used simultaneously to the Enlarging attack. The opposing forms of these are Collapse vs. Dispersal, Reduction vs. Gain, and Shrinkage vs. Growth. Only the matching form can completely protect a target from unwanted Enlargement; while the other two will apparently work, the final result can be a little weird if extreme ranks of Power are employed. The Nemeses are those Powers mentioned in the previous paragraph."),
        Geoforce(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Geoforce", 1, 0.05, "<b>Geoforce</b>: The hero can detect and control geological forces. These include plate movement, stress, faults, and vulcanism. This Power only applies to natural rock and semi-natural materials such as concrete, cement, and asphalt. Radically altered material (steel, plastic) is not directly affected by the Power. This Power has two ranges, both based on the Power rank. The ability to detect forces and materials within the earth has a range shown on Column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The ability to actually control those forces is more limited and is determined on Column B. For example, a hero with Remarkable Geoforce can detect forces 12 miles distant but can only control those forces within one mile of her location. The Detection aspect of this Power enables the hero to sense a variety of earth-related things. These include ground temperature (green FEAT), general mineral composition (green), specific minerals (red), locate caves (green), locate beings moving within the earth (yellow), identify faultlines and stress points (yellow), and communicate with beings made of rock (red). The active aspect of this Power enables the hero to accelerate, slow, or alter the direction of natural geological forces. The hero can affect plate movement; this can create Power rank tremors or reduce the intensity of existing tremors by the Power rank number. The hero can accelerate erosion by decreasing the Material Strength of exposed rock. The flow of magma within the earth can be redirected to anywhere the hero wants an instant baby volcano to erupt. By magnifying existing faults and decreasing the rock's Material Strength, the hero can create openings in the earth. These can be instant pits, valleys, caves, or tunnels. The effects of the Power are permanent alterations to the landscape. Baby volcanoes don't last very long, though, if the area didn't have a previous history of vulcanis,. For example, during her tenure with the New Mutants, Magma has created baby volcanoes in such places as Rio de Janeiro's harbor, the living room of Professor Xavier's man sion, and an apartment in Manhattan. Such freakish volcanoes immediately cool down once the Power is no longer supporting their existence; heat is lost at a rate of -1CS per hour. For example, the volcano in the X-Mansion was cool enough to sit on by the time Professor X came home a few hours later. It is assumed that the cooling effect extends all the way down back through the ground to where the magma came from in the first place; otherwise all these baby vol canoes would act as conduits for later, normal vulcanism. The amount of matter the Power can effect is awesome. The Power can affect a maximum amount of rock equivalent to ten tons for each point of the Power rank number. For example, Magma's Monstrous Geoforce can affect 750 tons (1.5 million pounds!) at a range of up to six miles. The Power can be expanded into a variety of Power Stunts, such as induced Avalanches and sculpting chambers in the earth. The latter example is also a way for the hero to make some money on the side by creating \"secret underground headquarters\" on commission. The giant caves that litter the pages of comic books do not occur in real life, people. A curious use of the Power is to communicate with beings who are themselves composed of natural rock. The Power provides the hero with a seismic equivalent of Telepathy. Such beings include Golems, Earth Elementals, and planetary beings such as Ego the Living Planet. Is Mother Earth alive in your campaign? If she is, then this Power will let your hero talk to her. The Nemeses for this Power include itself, Disintegration, and Phasing."),
        MatterAnimation(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Matter Animation", 2, 0.10, "<b>Matter Animation</b>: The hero can alter the flow of any raw matter, impart movement to stationary matter, and shape such matter into any desired form. The Power can only affect matter that is in a relatively natural state. It cannot affect mechanical objects or material that is now or had once been alive. There are three basic forms of this Power, each with dominion over a state of matter. When creating the hero, the player must choose one of these forms for the character. He can do this himself or let the dice choose for him. <table><tr><td>Die Roll</td><td>Form</td></tr><tr><td>01-20</td><td>Air Animation</td></tr><tr><td>21-50</td><td>Liquid Animation</td></tr><tr><td>51-00</td><td>Solid Animation</td></tr></table> Air Animation—The hero can directly control the movement of gases and vapors and indirectly control the movement of material suspended in the air, such as smoke, dust, steam, and so on. He can create winds of speeds equal to Power rank speed (see the Airspeed table on the inside cover). He can control the actions or air, wind, clouds, and potentially even the weather. The hero can use air either defensively or offensively by forming shields or gales of Power rank strength. Note: Air attacks cannot penetrate Force Fields or an aerial shield of higher Intensity. The Power can be developed into Power Stunts such as Gliding, Whirlwind Flight, and limited Weather Control. The forms of Weather Control available to the hero all depend on stirring up the air. These include bringing in storms, fog, tornadoes, and suddenly bringing two air masses of differing temperature together to form either fog or lightning. Liquid Animation—The hero can directly control the movement of liquids and indirectly control material suspended in liquid (mud, cake batter). He can create currents and waves that can travel at Power rank speed (see the Water Travel table on the inside cover) and do Power rank damage to anything in their path. Liquid can animated to resist gravity and act as if it were temporarily a solid of rank level Material Strength. Liquids can be used as a shield that reduces the Intensity of Energy Attacks by the Power rank number. It can be further refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as forming propulsion systems or being shaped into air bubbles with \"solid\" floors. Solid Animation—The hero can alter the condition of solid matter, so long as it is not biological or mechanical in nature. He can give the solid movement, reshape to any form, and even give it the semblance of life. Solids can travel at Power rank speed (see the Land Travel table inside the cover) either across the ground or through the air. The hero can Mold the solid into any single mass. Solids retain their Material Strength but can be Animated to do Power rank damage to other targets. The hero can create Golems or simulated Elementals that obey his every whim; such creations are only sophisticated puppets that possess no more life than does a marionette. (Of course, there is the example of Pinocchio…) Animated solids possess a Lifting Strength equal to the Power rank. The Power can be refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as turning an opponent's weapon against him, creating self-tying knots, and creating flying platforms that can carry the hero across the ground or through the air. The range at which the hero can Animate Matter is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column B of the Range Table. The maximum amount that can be Animated is a mass weighing the equivalent of 1000 pounds times the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank can move one ton; in liquid terms this is the weight of a water bed. Matter remains Animated as long as the hero concentrates on using this Power. Judges are free to develop their own criteria to determine how well and how long a hero can do this in a given situation. Any material can be Animated, as long as it is within the restrictions on the chosen form of that Power. Any reshaping done to the target is permanent; of course, this only applies to solids. The possibilities for both construction and vandalism are immense. At the time the hero is created, the player has the option of raising the Power rank +1CS by further specializing the Power's range of effect to a specific compound or type of matter. Examples of specializations include Powers that specifically Animate steam, water, oil, ice, clay, and so on. The Nemeses for this Power include itself and Disintegration."),
        MachineAnimation(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Machine Animation", 2, 0.07, "<b>Machine Animation</b>: The hero can control the movement of anything mechanical. It is as if the hero were a combination remote-control panel and power source. The machines can only perform those functions for which they were designed. While under the influence of the Power, the affected machines can function even in the absence of a normal power supply, such as would be provided by an electric cord, wound spring, or miniature nuclear generator. The only new function the hero can give a machine is limited ground movement. Affected Machines can travel at -2CS Power rank speed by sliding or rocking along the ground; see the Surface Movement table inside the cover. If the machine already incorporates a means of propulsion (wheels, tracks, table legs), it can travel at Power rank speed; see ditto. The Power can affect any single machine within range of the Power; Column B of the Range Table gives the appropriate limits. If the hero attempts to control several machines simultaneously, the Range decreases -1CS for each additional Machine the hero is controlling. For example, a hero with Good Machine Animation can control a single machine 10 areas away, two machines 5 areas away, three machines within his area, or four machines if he is touching all of them at once (an interesting Agility FEAT, I suppose). The Power is primarily intended to control normally non-sentient devices, which are considered to have a Psyche of zero. If the hero tries to gain control of a Robot or the mechanical part of a Cyborg, greater effort is needed. It becomes a contest of wills, as the hero's Power tries to overcome the target's Psyche. The Psyche in question is either that of the Robotic brain or the living mind of a Cyborg; if the Cyborg incorporates both living and mechanical minds, only the Psyche of the mechanical mind is used to determine the difficulty of the FEAT. The latter determines what Intensity FEAT is required. Example: A Poor rank of Machine Animation could seize control of a Dreadnought's Feeble Psyche with a green FEAT and Ultron-11's Poor Psyche with a yellow FEAT, but couldn't begin to touch Jocasta's Good Psyche. Attempting to wrest control of the Iron Man armor would require a red FEAT if either Tony Stark or Jim Rhodes were wearing it at the time but would automatically succeed if the armor were, say, hanging in a closet somewhere. To protect against such interference, High Technology types would need to develop circuitry that would give the equivalent of a desired Psyche rank to the machine.

        MicroEnvironment(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Micro-Environment", 2, 0.05, "<b>Micro-Environment</b>: The hero can alter his immediate surroundings to create a miniature climate around himself. The Micro-Environment always contains fresh clean air (or water or methane or whatever the hero breathes) at any temperature and pressure the hero desires. The Micro-Environment incorporates a Force Field that protects it from any factor that might harm or even annoy the hero, such as rain, poisonous gases, extreme temperatures, or the pressure that naturally results from having three miles of ocean over your head. In such cases, the Micro- Environment automatically excludes potentially hazardous gases and liquids and reduces the Intensity of pressure, extreme temperature, and high gravity by the Power rank number. Lesser or equal Intensities are canceled out, while higher ranks only penetrate in diminished form. The Power automatically Collects the desired materials into a sphere around the hero; if no such materials are available, the Power employs an innate form of Matter Creation or Conversion to produce those materials. The Force Field maintains the desired pressure, temperature, and gravity levels while enclosing the desired materials and shielding the hero from the undesired ones. If the hero requires a surface to stand on but none is available, the Power provides one by solidifying a section of the Force Field. The Power is primarily intended to protect the hero when he is in places other than his home environment. It can, be used to protect him from extreme variations in that home environment though, should the hero so choose. Thus the Power can be used to protect the hero in the middle of a house fire, gas leak at a fertilizer plant, radiation spill at a laboratory, a thunderstorm, or a smog alert in Los Angeles. The Power can be used to Resist the effects of Air or Water Animation, Weather Control, Heat, or Cold Generation; the Intensity of the attack is reduced by the Power rank number. The Micro-Environment has a maximum radius in-feet equal to the Power rank number. Normally it is a sphere centered in the hero but she can shape it or direct it to another location if she so desires. The maximum range at which the hero can direct the MicroEnvironment is determined by the Power rank; appropriate distances are shown on Column B on the Range Table. The maximum volume of the Micro- Environment is the equivalent of a sphere whose radius equals the Power rank number. Figuring out the maximum volume of other shapes requires a doing a bit of geometry. Example: A rank of Good can produce a sphere of 3.14(10-cubed) or 3,140 cubic feet. This can be shaped into a rectangular \"tunnel\" 10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 31 feet long. I suggest that anyone with this Power figure out as soon as possible how big a sphere/ hemisphere/column/tunnel/cone/etcetera he can make with his Power rank. If you don't, the Judge is liable to say that mysterious changes in the. environment prevent your hero's Power from working. The Power only protects the hero from environmental effects or Powers that employ aspects of the Environment. Beside the Powers mentioned earlier, this Power will also provide limited protection against Electrical Control, Electrical Generation, Coldshaping, Gravity Manipulation, Hard Radiation and its Control, Thermal Control, Plague Carrier, Geoforce, Spray, and Pheromones, but only if the offending Power originates outside the Micro-Environment. As hinted at before, the Power can be used to create any environment the hero desires, provided it is beneficial to whatever nature of being is inside its protection. Of course, what is a marvelous climate for one being could be instantly fatal to another. Consider the MicroEnvironments created by beings that thrive on super-heated steam or swim in liquid helium. Player characters are limited to producing only those MicroEnvironments that will help the beings inside. Villainous and Mind- Controlled NPC heroes are able to pervert the Power and create toxic MicroEnvironments. In such a case, the Power is treated as an attack and the intended victim is urged to Resist it in any way he can.

        Molding(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Molding", 1, 0.10, "<b>Molding</b>: The hero can shape any solid material into any desired shape. The shaped material retains its original chemical nature. If the target is living, its internal anatomy is rearranged in such a way that permits life to continue without loss of Health. The new shape can be of any complexity; even intricate machines can be created if the proper materials are available. The newly-Molded target can be Animated, even if the original material or the current shape is normally incapable of movement. This movement is accomplished by the simple act of continually re-Molding the target (think of it in terms of stop-motion animation). Molded targets retain their basic Material Strength. New shapes may alter the load-bearing capacity of the material. For example, a arch can bear greater weight than a plane and a honeycomb is about the strongest shape there is. Using the Power destructively is easy; using it constructively is harder and requires the player to have some knowledge of basic Engineering. The maximum range at which the hero can Mold a target is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate distances are. shown on Column A of the Range Table. The amount of material the hero can Mold is a mass weighing 100 pounds times the Power rank number. When creating the hero, the player has the option of raising either range or amount affected by lowering the other factor an equal amount. For example, a Remarkable rank can Mold 3,000 pounds of material at a range of 8 areas. Either factor can be altered by as much as 5CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (contact)/Shift X effect (15,000 lb.) to Shift X range (80 areas)/Feeble effect (200 lb.). The player has the further option of raising the Power rank +1CS by specializing in Molding a particular type of matter, such as wood, metal, stone, and so on. This option is not available if the hero also possesses any of the Elemental or Molecular Conversion or Creation Powers. The complexity of the intended design determines what Reason FEAT is needed. Simple, single-component designs require a green Reason FEAT. Complex or multiple-component designs require a yellow FEAT. Extremely complex designs (anything from a clock on up) requires a red FEAT and probably a set of blueprints. Exactly duplicating an existing object also requires a red Reason FEAT. The Power can function for as long as the hero can concentrate. Any failed rolls while attempting a FEAT mean that while the Power has begun to Mold the target, there is a problem because \"something doesn't look quite right.\" Molding automatically affects any stationary, non-living, unprotected material. Moving targets require the hero to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power in the same way they would try to Resist any Energy Attack. As mentioned earlier, living targets can be affected but not directly slain by this Power. A target can be protected from being Molded by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, temporary Conversion to a liquid or gaseous state, or an equal or higher rank of Molding. The simultaneous use of a protective Molding Power to counteract an offensive one by continually re-Molding the target into its original shape would look positively psychedelic as the target of both Molders continually rippled and wavered). The Power can be used quite profitably to outfit either heroes or villains with all the arcane and exotic equipment they need. After all, Quinjets, body armor, and nuclear pogo-sticks aren't exactly off-the shelf purchases. Clever use of this Power could raise the hero's Resource level anywhere from +1CS to +4CS; the Judge and player will have to work this out for themselves.

        Weather(PowerClass.MatterControl, "Weather", 1, 0.10, "<b>Weather Control</b>: The hero has complete control over the weather. He can sense those factors in the air that create weather and alter any aspect of them at his desire. Any of these factors can produce both physical and psychological effects on humans. He can control temperature by raising or lowering the air a maximum number of degrees equal to his Power rank number. For example, an Incredible rank can change a comfortable 70 degrees into a wintry 30 degrees or a sweltering 100 degrees. He can increase or decrease windspeed by a number of miles per hour equal to his Power rank number. For example, an Excellent rank can stop a 20-mph wind, slow a 50-mph gale to 30mph, or turn still air into a 20-mph wind. Gale winds of 40-mph or higher begin to make travel difficult. Whole gales of 55 to 72 mph begin to do widespread damage. Winds above 72 mph reach hurricane strength. Above 200 mph the wind becomes a tornado. Wind direction can be changed up to 60 degrees by a green Power FEAT, up to 120 degrees by a yellow FEAT, and completely reversed 180 degrees by a red FEAT. For example, changing a cool northern wind to an east wind is a change of 90 degrees, a yellow FEAT. Humidity can be increased or decreased a maximum percentage equal to the Power rank number. Note: the maximum humidity is 100%. Apparently humidity has some effect on human behavior and health. As humidity approaches 80% or higher, people become more sluggish and irritable, especially if the air temperature is also 80 degrees or higher. If the air has any moisture at all, the hero can Collect it into any type of cloud, whether Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, a common Fog, or any other type. He can form Nimbostratus clouds that continually disgorge moisture in the form of rain, hail, sleet,-or snow, depending on the air temperature and wind direction. Rainfall per hour can reach a maximum number of inches equal to the Power rank number. If the precipitation falls as snow, the snowfall depth is equal to six inches for each inch of rainfall (since snowflakes pack less densely than rain). The Power can form Cumulonimbus clouds into thunderheads that deliver lightning as well as rain. The hero can control the emission and direction of lightning, producing bolts that do rank damage. The area of weather over which the hero has control is a circle (a vertical cylinder actually) with the Weather Controller at the center. The diameter and height of this cylinder is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate distances are shown on Column C of the Range Table. For example, when she possessed her full Amazing Weather Control, Storm could control the weather over a fifty-mile wide area. Note: While the atmosphere is composed of four layers and is a few hundred miles deep, only the bottom layers of the troposphere and stratosphere really affect the surface weather. Beyond twenty miles in height, the Power is reduced to a negligible effect. The duration of the effect the Power has over the weather varies. The hero has a limited amount of time each day she can actively Control the weather. The maximum length of time is the number of minutes equal to the hero's Health. Each minute spent using this Power temporarily costs the hero one point. Note: this does not decrease the hero's actual Health; instead it decreases a \"dummy account\" set up for the purposes of the player's bookkeeping. The account is replenished at the start of each new day. Returning to the example of Storm, her Amazing rank enabled her to actively control the weather fifty minutes each day. Furthermore, the effect the Power has over the weather does not instantly vanish when the hero rests. The changes the hero made continue for a while before things return to their original state. Lingering effects last an amount of time equal to the time spent actively controlling the Weather. The Intensity rank of the lingering Weather slowly decreases; the average Intensity rank is half that of the Power rank. For example, if Storm spent ten minutes operating a thunderstorm, that storm would last an additional ten minutes and produce Excellent rainfall and lightning while it slowly dissipated. As mentioned briefly, the hero can detect any aspect of the Weather that he can control. A green FEAT enables the hero to know the local wind's speed and direction, humidity, temperature, the chance for precipitation, and the next day's weather forecast. A yellow FEAT enables the hero to detect these thing anywhere within her Power's range and thus figure out the weather forecast for the next two days. A red FEAT enables the hero to make three-day weather forecasts and more importantly detect the cause and location of any change in the weather, such as distant disturbances or the use of this Power by others elsewhere. For example, with a yellow FEAT the hero senses a mass of hot air twenty-three miles away. A red FEAT enables her to detect the cause as a fire raging in New Rochelle. A peculiar use of the Power involves gaseous beings such as Air Elementals. The hero can create puppets of air whose actions simulate the behavior of Air Elementals. The hero can directly combat real Air Elementals with the Power doing rank damage to the opponent's Health. Imagine this as a vaporous equivalent of a Slugfest. Finally, the Power can serve as a means to communicate with gaseous beings. In this case the Power acts as an equivalent to Telepathy.

The hero, um… well, the character with this Power can Animate any previously living body. Normally, the Power is used to Animate relatively intact cadavers, since these are capable of a greater variety of actions. Part of the Power is used to halt the process of decay and to maintain the structural integrity of the remaining body parts. Still, Zombies look awful, even the fresh ones. This Power is not Biophysical Control/Revival. The Zombies are not alive. They lack the essential lifeforce that is the core of each living being. The Zombies are at best mindless slaves, at worst grotesque marionettes who shuffle on the end of the Zombie Master's strings. The condition of a Zombie can range from freshly deceased to skeletal. The latter type of Zombie is little more than a walking skeleton, though being mostly bone it is cleaner than a still-fleshed Zombie. The Zombie does not have to have all its body parts. In fact, the Power can be used to Animate detached limbs or partial remains. These have their uses too. For example, if a character's Physical Type is either Cyborg or Compound/Undead and he possesses this Power, perhaps some of his body parts are Animated bones grafted onto his still living sections.

The Zombie Animator Can create a single Zombie in a process whose minimum time gets shorter as the Power rank gets higher. It comes in two stages, Preparation and Activation. The required Preparation time is the number of rounds equal to 101 minus the Power rank number. For example, a Good rank can prepare a Zombie for Animation in 91 turns, a Monstrous rank can do it 4n 26 turns, and any rank -higher than Unearthly doesn't need any Preparation time at all. The next step is Activation. All this requires is a successful red Power FEAT. Failure requires the Animator to Prepare for another minute. It is possible, if however unlikely, for a character to have this Power and never, ever be able to successfully Animate a Zombie. That's one of the mysteries of random chance. Once he creates a Zombie, the Animator retains control over it until it is destroyed, returned to life, or stolen away by a higher ranked Undead Controller. An Animator can create an infinite supply of Zombies but can only retain direct control of a number of them equal to his Psyche rank number. For example, an Animator with an Excellent Psyche can control up to twenty Zombies simultaneously. Any Zombies over that number are in effect free agents who can act independently. Such free Zombies never attack their Animator though. Curiously, some Zombies retain some of their Resources and Contacts. This is an extremely rare occurrence and is only possible if the Zombie is in a near-perfect condition (albeit of course dead) and if the late person's death was not widely known. In such a case, a clever Zombie Animator can make the Zombie pretend to still be alive. For example, Nekra Animated the corpse of the Grim Reaper so well that the risen Zombie actually believed he was alive. Zombies are immune to attacks based on Psionics or other Mental Powers, Disease, poisons, Pheromones, Hard Radiation, and Sonics. They cannot see Illusions. They have Power rank Resistance to most of the Lifeform Control Powers; the Power rank that created them decreases such Powers by that number. The exception is Undead Control, with which a green FEAT can permit control of any independent Zombie. Some aspect of the original mind remains. Zombies possess rudimentary memories of their previous existence. A Zombies is also linked to the Spirit that once dwelled within it and can be used as a tool to Communicate with, Summon, and Control that Spirit. The use of a Zombie in this way increases the other Powers' rank +1CS. It is possible return the Spirit to its now-Zombie body by use of the Forced Reincarnation. Although this does not return the body to actual life, it does weld the spirit and body together so well that only the total destruction of the body will free the spirit again. Such a Spirited Zombie possesses his original Mental Abilities and can work at restoring the other Abilities to their original levels. The effect of Bio-Physical Control on a Zombie is peculiar. Zombies don't actually Heal since that is a function of living organisms. Any attempt to Heal a Zombie actually kills it by negating the Animation. Only Revival will truly return the Zombie to life, as it negates the Animation, cures any damage or decay, and draws the spirit back home. Note: if the Spirit is now Reincarnated elsewhere, this action creates a person with a newborn's mind and spirit. Okay, so why would anyone want to Animate Zombies, particularly so-called heroes? The popular misconception is that Zombies are inherently evil. This is not true. Zombies are only a reflection of their Animator's personality. A currently popular fantasy series features a goodwilled if misunderstood character whose sole Magical Power is Zombie Animation. He uses them as servants and if necessary soldiers. He even used the Power on himself in order to wait out the centuries until his fiancee could return to life. Your character will have his own justifications and uses for this Power. The key thing, as always, to use your imagination and not be afraid to experiment. Be afraid of your experiment's results instead. Optional Powers include Extradimensional Detection (limited to detecting spirit realms), Forced Reincarnation, Summoning (Spirits only), Undead Control, and Communication with Nonliving Matter. The Nemeses for this Power include Exorcism, Healing, and Undead Control."){

        //Matter Conversion
        Coloration(PowerClass.MatterConversion, "Coloration", 1, 0.10, "<b>Coloration</b>: The hero has total control over the coloration and color transmitting abilities of any target substance, whether solid. liquid, or gaseous. That's all, folks. Okay, this seems like the prime number one Wimp Power of all time. Wrong, oh ye of little faith; read on and I'll tell you how dangerous this Power can be it is when possessed by a clever hero. This Power enables the hero to alter basic physics and the chemical properties of any target. The Power operates in either of these two modes. In the first mode, the hero can consciously alter the frequency and intensity of light itself. He can change any frequency to any other frequency, including infrared, the visible spectrum, and ultraviolet. Like a prism, the Power can split apart white light into a rainbow or re-combine back into white. He can lower the intensity of light to create normal darkness, even in the midst of brilliant fight, though these shadows lack the opacity of those created by Shadowcasting. In game terms, consider this a -2CS form of both Shadowcasting and Shadowshaping. Different frequencies of light have different properties. By altering the frequency of light, the hero can alter these properties. Infrared light causes objects to heat up. By converting normal light to infrared, the hero can cause a -2CS form of Heat Emission. Conversely, by converting Infrared light, the hero can prevent radiant heating; treat this as a - 2CS Force Field vs. Heat. Ultraviolet light causes changes in pigmentation; effects can vary from the tanning of normal human skin to the rapid fading of printed material. It is also the key to photosynthesis. If the light is in a coherent form, like a laser beam, the effects of color become more dramatic. Red lasers carry more heat and do greater damage for the Intensity. Blue-green lasers can pass unhindered through water. Again, change the frequency of light and you change its effects. The second operating mode for the Power is altering the physical coloration of the target material. The color of a object can have great importance both to the fickle aesthetic tastes of humans and to the impartiality of Moms Nature. Coloration determines the type and amount of energy that is either reflected or absorbed by the material in question. White and silvery surfaces reflect all light. Dark colors and black absorb all light. There is the matter of transparency. A perfectly clear substance lets light pass through. Examples include air, glass, and the lens in a human eye. Change the degree of transparency and you stop light from traveling though. A character with this Power can stop anything in its tracks if the target depends on vision to find its way around. Conversely, the Power can make an opaque target transparent. Uses for this vary from humane through mischievous to outright criminal. A humane use is curing those types of blindness that result from the loss of the eye's natural transparency. A mischievous use is turning someone's clothing transparent. A criminal use is turning concealing barriers transparent if the character is seeking information behind that barrier; this can be anything from reading the contents of an envelope or locked file cabinet to studying a lock's mechanism while cracking the combination. Color conveys information. Change the color and you alter or even destroy the message. Consider the effect changing color has on things as varied as comic books, paintings, photographic film, traffic lights, feathers, furs, and human skin. Take the last one, for example. The reason why people get so freaked out by the Hulk is not his size or berserk rampages but that he is bright green! Give the Hulk a normal tan and he could work in Hollywood. On a more prosaic level, the ability to change the color of printed or written material can be have immense consequences in an Information Age society such as our own. The possibilities include both vandalism and creation. When using this Power, the hero must make a Reason FEAT to determine how fine his degree of control is. A green FEAT permits him to change all of a target to a single color; think of the target getting a paint can dumped on it. A Yellow FEAT enables him to change the target to several colors. The effect is the same as being caught by a bunch of near-sighted graffiti artists, each with a different can of spray paint. A Red FEAT gives the hero fine control and the ability to alter tiny areas in specific ways; think of a talented artist with a very small brush. When the hero is covering an area, he only affects the exposed surface of any targets. For example, Colorizing a closed book would not harm the printed pages; Colorizing a cow purple wouldn't change the color of a steak later on. As for the question of affecting the eyes of a living target, the Judge and players should assume that the Power only affects the layer of tears that protect the eye. In effect, the target is momentarily blinded by colored water that quickly washes away. Eyes are such a small target that the character must make a specific red FEAT to do so. Note: this bending of the rules does not apply to the lenses of artificial eyes; cameras and robots are on their own. This Power does not actually change the physical nature of a target. Elemental, molecular, and genetic structures remain unchanged except where Light is concerned. A steel safe made glass-like is still as strong as ever. A pane of glass given a steel-like surface shatters just as before. The duration of the Power varies. The normal limit is 1 -100 hours after the Coloration occurs. The hero can immediately reverse any Coloration if he chooses. Sometimes the hero wants an act of Coloration to be permanent, such as when he tries to cure an old man's cataracts. In that case, a red Power FEAT does the trick. Optional Powers include Light Control. Nemesis Powers are Radar or Sonar."){

        Combustion(PowerClass.MatterConversion, "Combustion", 1, 0.15, "<b>Combustion</b>: The hero has the ability to transform any target into combustible material. Once this Power has been used, spontaneous combustion occurs within 1 -10 turns after. Only the surface layer of matter is converted by this Power. As such, the flames only last 10-20 turns since the combustible material is quickly burned away. The total amount of damage done by this is equal to Power rank Intensity. Example: Rusty Collins, a student of X Factor, has Monstrous Combustion but has not yet achieved full control over it. At present, when he is excited, he can inflict up to Incredible Intensity damage on a target. When his Power first appeared, his accidental target was a woman who subsequently suffered severe burns. The range for the Power is determined on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The maximum amount of target area the hero can initially affect is the number of square feet equal to his Power rank times ten. For example, when he is fully trained in the use of his Power, Rusty Collins will be able to ignite an area of 750 square feet at a distance of 40 areas (1 mile) away. The Power only affects the surface of a target that is in sight of the hero. Using the Power against a gasoline tank would only burn the outside of the tank and any gasoline that had already leaked through bad joints in the tank walls. If the damage were sufficient to rupture the tank or heat the gasoline inside to the combustion point, then the stored liquid could join the blaze. The Power's effects begin to multiply when the power is used against targets that are already flammable or in the immediate vicinity of flammable materials. Most of Mankind’s manufactured items and buildings contain some percentage of flammable material. Even materials not known for their combustible qualities, like plaster, will burn if enough heat is applied. By taking this into consideration, the clever hero can simply use his Power as the spark to start an apparently normal fire. Combustion normally occurs only in the presence of free oxygen. If there's no oxygen in the air or if there is no air, period, Combustion cannot take place. Using this Power on a target under such a circumstance would have no immediate effect on the target. While the Power would still convert some of the target into, flammable, volatile compounds, these would simply and harmlessly evaporate; used under water, the Power would make bubbles suddenly appear on the target. At Unearthly rank or higher, the hero gains the ability to transform some of the target into free oxygen as well as fuel, thus permitting the Power the Power to function in a vacuum or hostile environment. If the target is affected by the Power but the flames are somehow prevented from occurring, the target will only remain potentially flammable for 21 to 30 turns after the Power has had its initial effect. At any point during that time, the target can still burst into flame; after that has elapsed, the target is safe. Means that can prevent Combustion from occurring include Elemental and Molecular Conversion, Fire Control, Thermal Control, Cold Generation, Force Field vs. Energy, and Resistance to Energy. Any of these Powers gives its possessor Power rank Resistance to Combustion's effects. Example: Rusty Collins is battling a Sentinel. He uses his Monstrous Power to set fire to the Sentinel's faceplate. The Sentinel reacts by spraying extinguishing foam on itself. The foam has Unearthly fire retardant qualities and prevents the Combustion-affected area from igniting. Unfortunately for the Sentinel, it only lasts 25 turns after initial application. As the Sentinel grabs Rusty, his faceplate belatedly but still spectacularly bursts into flame. Optional Powers include Fire Generation and Control. Nemeses include Elemental and Molecular Conversion, Cold Generation, Fire Control, and Thermal Control."){

        Disintegration(PowerClass.MatterConversion, "Disintegration", 1, 0.20, "<b>Disintegration</b>: This is the ever popular but never explained \"Disintegrator Ray.\" The hero has the ability to convert any matter into pure energy, usually Light although the player can specify another resultant energy when he first creates the character. The energy dissipates harmlessly and does not affect anyone in the vicinity. This Power can affect any target within range and line-of-sight. The range is determined by Power rank; resulting distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table. The maximum amount of matter that can be disintegrated in a single turn is the number of cubic feet equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Typical Disintegrator can destroy six cubic feet of matter at a range of two areas or 264 feet. When creating the character, the player can alter the Power range or effect if he so chooses. Either the range or the amount affected can be increased any number of Column Shifts by decreasing the other factor an equal amount. Example: Ken and Sue are both creating Disintegrators. Ken rolls 97 for his Power rank, an awesome Amazing rank for both range and effect. Sue isn't so lucky and rolls 77, a Good rank for her Cyborg Character. Sue wants deadlier force and chooses to after her range and effect. She decreases her range to Feeble or Contact-only, a loss of -3CS that she can apply to her effect. This increases +3CS to an Incredible effect. Unwilling targets of this Power are allowed to resist it in any way they can. Furthermore, the Disintegrator must make an Agility FEAT to aim this Power on a target. I mentioned the maximum area the Disintegrator can effect, but what of the minimum area? The Power comes in handy for doing all sorts of fine-detailed work like sculpting, surgery, or removing unwanted locks. The hero can Disintegrate as small an area as he can clearly see. With normal, unaided vision, the minimum limit is about 1/128th of an inch. Smaller than that and the hero needs some kind of magnifying device or Power. Note: this limit is proportional to a normally-sized human of about six feet in height. Enlarged or miniaturized characters have a proportional limit. For example, a 36-foot-tall giant would have a minimum limit of 1/21 of an inch, while a one-foot-tall person would have a minimum limit of 1/768th of an inch or about the size of a cell. As stated earlier, the target must be within line of sight since the Power affects the first thing it encounters, excluding air molecules. Actually, some air is accidentally Disintegrated whenever this Power is used-that's why the Power appears as a glowing beam emitted by the hero-but not enough to divert the Power from its intended target. If an unseen or unanticipated barrier is present between the Disintegrator and the target, that barrier takes the full brunt of the Power that turn. Ken's hero, Starburst, sights a Dreadnought and immediately tries to Disintegrate it. Unfortunately, Starburst failed to notice the plate glass window the Dreadnought was behind. The window vanishes in a flash of pretty lights as the Dreadnought ducks around the corner. This Power is frequently given, to weapons systems such as the ever popular Disintegrator Pistols that fill pulp SciFi. In terms of normal contemporary Earth technology, a Disintegrator raygun requires Incredible Reason and Physics Talent to design and an Amazing cost in Resource points to build. The Judge is free to decide the range and effect of such a weapon. Nemeses for Disintegration are Phasing (to protect the hero) and Ionization (to protect others) as the Power cannot affect intangible matter."),
        ElementalConversion(PowerClass.MatterConversion, "Elements", 2, 0.25, "<b>Elemental Conversion</b>: The hero can convert any matter into a specific element. The matter to be converted can be any one element or a combination of elements. The resulting element can be any of the hundred-odd natural, artificial, and mythical elements. Natural elements are those numbered 1 (Hydrogen) to 92 (Uranium) on the Periodic Table; these require a green FEAT to create. Artificial elements are those numbering higher than 92 and do not naturally occur on Earth outside of man's experiments; such elements include Neptunium, Plutonium, and the like. A yellow FEAT is required to create these. Mythical elements include Vibranium and any other imaginary element the Judge decides to add to this category; a red FEAT is required to create these. Note: it has never been established whether Vibranium is an element or a compound; Judges are therefore instructed to decide which category Adamantium fits into in the Judge's campaign. The hero can alter a finite amount of matter per turn. The maximum amount per turn is the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. The amount of matter weighs the same in its original and transformed states. If the hero converts matter into denser elements, the volume decreases. Converting matter to lighter elements increases the volume. For example, one cubic foot of lead weighs the same as 17.5 cubic feet of carbon. Just exploiting this little fact of life can lead the hero to develop a variety of Power Stunts. For example, the hero might cause a sudden vacuum in a room by converting all air to a dense solid, like bismuth. Normally, when matter is converted by this Power, it retains its new nature permanently or at least until a reverse transformation is forced on it at a later date. At the time the hero is created, the player has an option of increasing his Power rank by making the Power's effect temporary. The hero can gain +1CS by reducing the duration of his transformations to the number of turns equal to his Reason rank number. For example, a hero with Good Reason and Poor Elemental Conversion can convert four pounds of material that reverts to its original state in ten hours. The normal form of this Power is fatal if used on a living target. Tissue transformed by the Power suffers instantaneous death. If the hero chooses the option of temporary effect, the Power has a different effect on living tissue. The affected area enters Suspended Animation until it reverts to its original state. This can also be developed into a variety of Power Stunts. Of course, if only part of the living target is transformed, the rest of the body still suffers the shock of having part of itself transformed into nonliving elements. The minimum amount of matter that can be transformed is limited only by the hero's sight. If the hero can see it, he can transform it. The practical limit for unaided human vision is 1/128th of an inch. Lest you think your hero is going to retire to Brazil and spend the rest of his days turning weeds to gold, let me warn you about the drawbacks. Each pound of matter the hero converts temporarily costs him a point of Health. This is automatically regained, after 24 hours. On the business side, there is the question of selling the raw elements. Gold, platinum, and other rare, valuable elements are kept strictly accounted for by a variety of governmental and business organizations. If your hero makes a habit of coming up with large amounts of bullion, someone is going to begin to notice. That someone could be anyone from a relatively benign IRS agent come to audit your hero's accounts to a sinister agent of the Gold Cartel come to shut down the new competitor (i.e., kill your hero). About the only choice your hero has is selling small amounts to local precious metals dealers. Going this route can raise your hero's Resource rank +3CS; any more than that and somebody will notice and take action. The range at which the Power can operate is determined by the Power rank. Distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. When creating the hero, the player can choose the option of increasing either the amount affected or the range by decreasing the other factor an equal amount. For example, a Typical rank can convert six pounds of matter at a distance of two areas. Either factor can be modified a maximum of 2CS. One way produces a hero who has Feeble effect (two pounds) but Excellent range (6 areas). Going the opposite route produces a hero with Excellent effect (20 pounds) but Feeble range (contact only). Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected. Moving targets require an Agility FEAT by the hero to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power just as they could any other attack. Protections against this Power include Force Field vs. Energy Attack, Resistance to Energy Attack, True Invulnerability, various Magics, and various Power Controls. Any of these completely protect against a lesser ranked Elemental Conversion and have a limited affect against equal or greater ranks. The Judge is free to decide the results of partial protection against this Power. Optional Powers include Matter Animation and Molding. The Nemeses include Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, and True Invulnerability."),
        Ionization(PowerClass.MatterConversion, "Ionization", 1, 0.10, "<b>Ionization</b>: The hero has the ability to change the state of energy in a target. This can have a variety of effects on the target. A target can be electrified by this Power; the target's atoms begin to change into electrically-charged particles. The initial effect this has is to charge the target with static electricity. Next the target actually emits Electricity at -1CS Intensity. At this point the target will itself suffer an equal amount of damage, provided it is electrically grounded in some way. Finally, the charged atoms begin to fly off in an ionized cloud. Nonliving targets can be destroyed in this manner as the molecular bonds break down. Used this way, the Power does damage equal to - 2CS Disintegration. Okay, what about beneficial uses for this Power? Well, electricity isn't the only energy the hero can charge a target with when he uses this Power. The hero can excite the atoms sufficiently to create warmth; this is treated as a -2CS form of Heat. More interestingly, the hero can charge atoms in such a way that he can make them temporarily ethereal. A target thus affected can Phase through solid matter as easily as someone already in possession of that Power. This comes in handy when the hero is trying to protect a target from any of the Matter Conversion Powers. He can use this Power to Phase something threatened by the other Power or made threatening because of it. The range at which Ionization can occur and its duration are determined by the Power rank. Range is shown on Column A on the Range Table. Duration is a maximum number of rounds equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank can charge a target within reach for two turns. The amount of material affected is generally limited to a man-sized continuous mass. If the target is a specific area of a much larger mass, the Ionization will directly affect only the mansized area, although the rest of the mass can experience secondary effects based on whatever the hero is trying to do. For example, The Shocker has to Ionize a safe in which some people are trapped. He plans to try to Disintegrate a section of the safe large enough to permit fresh air to enter. There is a danger of electrocution to those trapped within, so Shocker tells them to stand on something that can insulate them from the metal walls and floor. They hurriedly cover themselves with stacks of $100 bills. Outside, Shocker summons his Power. The safe is a 15-foot cube with walls two feet thick. Selecting a section of the safe's wall with no essential mechanisms inside, he begins. He has a Incredible rank. In the first turn, static electricity crackles in the air; inside the safe, loose bills stand on end. In the second turn, electricity of Remarkable Intensity begins to be generated by the affected area. The safe's lock shorts out as the electricity flows throughout the metal sections of the safe; inside the safe the air begins to smell of ozone. In the third turn, Disintegration of Excellent Intensity begins to occur. Shocker is bathed in a cloud that resembles a fluorescent lamp without the tube. The safe walls are constructed of reinforced concrete and steel, giving it Remarkable material strength. For Shocker to execute any meaningful Disintegration, he needs to make a red FEAT based on the diminished Disintegration rank, rather than his normal Ionization rank. Shocker's player needs to roll a 95 or higher to burn through the safe. It takes him 11 turns or over a minute to finally accomplish the deed. Hours later it occurred to The Shocker that he could simply have used his Power to make part of the safe temporarily out-of-Phase with the rest of the world. Had he done that, those trapped inside could simply have walked through the temporarily ethereal wall. The Nemesis Power is Energy Sponge."),
        MolecularConversion(PowerClass.MatterConversion, "Molecular Conversion", 2, 0.20, "<b>Molecular Conversion</b>: The hero can transform any material into a desired compound. This Power is an enhanced version of Elemental Conversion. Whereas that Power could only create a single specified element, this Power can create a number of elements simultaneously and arrange them in a desired molecular configuration. The matter to be converted can be composed of any element, compound, or combination thereof. The elements that result can be any of the hundred-odd natural, artificial, and mythical elements. The compounds they form can likewise be real or mythical. An example of a fictional compound is the alloy Adamantium, a steel alloy that only exists in the Marvel Universe. Mythical compounds or compounds that incorporate a mythical element (like Vibranium) require a red FEAT to create. Note: it has never been established whether Vibranium is an element or a compound; while I choose to refer to Vibranium as an element, Judges are free to decide for themselves whether it is an element or a compound in their campaign. Most other compounds require either a green or yellow FEAT to create. The more complex a compound's formula is, the harder it is to create. As a rule of thumb, a compound whose molecules incorporate from two to twenty atoms can be created by a green FEAT. A compound with molecules of from twenty-one to one hundred atoms, or alloys of various compounds, requires a yellow FEAT; examples include hydrocarbons. More complex molecules or alloys require a red FEAT; examples include polymers, proteins, and other compounds essential to life. Obviously, playing this Power requires knowledge of basic chemistry. At the least the player must have a crib sheet filled with various useful compounds and their formulas. The hero can after a finite amount of matter each turn. The mass limit is the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. The amount of matter converted weighs the same either before or after Conversion. The heavier the resulting compound, the smaller its volume. Conversely, the lighter the compound, the more volume it has. This simple fact can be exploited as a variety of Power Stunts. For example, a fistsized rock can be transformed into a roomful of the mixture of gases we humans consume as air. The maximum range at which the Power can affect a target is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. At the time the hero is created, the player has the option of increasing either the Power's range or amount affected by decreasing the remaining factor an equal amount. For example, an Amazing rank can Convert 50 pounds at a range of 20 areas. Either factor can be modified by up to 7CS. This can produce such extreme combinations as Feeble range (Contact only) and CL3000 effect (3000 pounds per turn) or CL3000 range (10,000 miles) and Feeble effect (two pounds). The player also has the option of increasing the Power +1CS by making its effect temporary. Normally, Conversions are permanent or at least remain until a reverse Conversion occurs. If the player chooses the temporary option, the Conversion only lasts a maximum number of turns equal to the hero's Reason rank number. While permanent Conversions may be fatal to living targets (it depends on what was Converted and what the result was), the temporary form has the side-effect of placing the target area into a form of Suspended Animation until the Conversion wears off. Of course, the Conversion can have severe, even fatal, effects on the rest of the living target if the entire body is not Converted. The target must be in line of sight of the hero for the Conversion to occur. The Power can function even if a normal, transparent barrier such as glass separates the hero and the target. The minimum amount of material that can be affected by the Power is limited only by the hero's eyesight. In practical terms, the smallest size a Normal Human can see is 1/128th of an inch. Below that requires the use of something to enhance the hero's vision. Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected by this Power. Moving targets require an Agility FEAT in order for the hero to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to resist Molecular Conversion just as they would any Energy Attack. Targets can be protected from being effected by this Power through the use of other Powers including Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, various Magics, and various Power Controls. Such Powers will completely protect against a lesser or equal rank Molecular Conversion and offer partial protection against higher ranks.

        ArtifactCreation(PowerClass.MatterCreation, "Artifact Creation", 2, 0.10, "<b>Artifact Creation</b>: The hero can create a desired object from virtually nothing. The artifact can be of any substance, and is limited to being composed of a single piece. Although the Power can create facsimiles of more complex construction, close examination reveals that all the smaller pieces are fused together. However, the hero can create complex items by forming them one piece at a time. The hero can create in one turn a number of ounces equal to his Power rank number. The durability of the artifact is determined at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the artifact a lifespan of the number of turns equal to the hero's Reason rank number times 100. A yellow FEAT raises it to 10,000 times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the artifact permanent. Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs the hero one Health point. The hero can regain all his lost Health points after 24 hours. Thus, the hero can only create a number of ounces in a single day equal to his Health point total. The hero must have detailed knowledge of the design of whatever he wants to create. He can only store a finite number of designs in his mind at any one time. The limit for this Power is equal to his Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of which items the hero knows how to create. The list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the hero a new design. If no memory slots are available, the new design replaces an old one. (\"That's okay; how many more Dr. Doom masks was I going to need, anyway?\") Editor's Note: Matter Creation Powers that create specific items (as opposed to raw matter) bring with them a specified number of memory slots, usually equal to the hero's Reason rank number. If a hero should have two of these specific Matter Creation Powers, he would then have twice the number of memory slots (equal to his Reason rank number times two once for each Power). Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of objects that already exist. These can be directly studied by the hero as he memorizes their designs. This takes at least ten minutes before attempting the FEAT. Failure requires another ten minutes of study, and another attempt. As you can guess, their hero might never be able to master certain designs. The hero can also create new designs based solely on his own imagination. Since this requires really intense concentration, a red Reason FEAT is needed to store this design. The artifact has the same properties as a normally manufactured item of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary designs, the player and the Judge should agree on reasonable statistics for the item in question. The hero can materialize the artifact at any site within one area. The artifact is initially stationary; you can't launch an artifact as you can a missile or a spray. The hero can take advantage of gravity, though, by materializing the artifact uphill or over a target. Now that you've read all the rules so far, I'll give you the one exception to the weight limit. When creating the character, the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of one specific item, like a suit of armor or a costume. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Red FEATs are treated as yellow FEATs. This Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each -element and compound takes up a memory slot, just like the daggers and shields that are already cluttering the hero's mind. Such raw matter can be formed in any shape, though. This permits the hero to change the composition of any of his alreadymemorized designs. For example, if he already has memorized a knife design and the nature of silver, he can make either a steel knife (like the one he memorized) or one made of silver. The hero can create facsimiles of living matter, but such facsimiles are not themselves capable of living. He can make a dead chicken, but not a live one; however, the one he makes will taste just as good. Being able to create corpse versions of yourself could be extremely handy, especially for villains out to confound the law.

The hero can create any desired element in any shape or at any location within one area. The hero can create in a single turn a number of ounces equal to his Power rank number. For example, a hero possessing this Power at Amazing rank could create 50 ounces per turn. The durability of the newly created matter is determined at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the element a lifespan of 100 turns times the hero's Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A Red FEAT means it is permanent. Example: Synthos needs some quick cash and tries to create gold he can sell. His Power is Excellent (20) but his Reason is only Typical (6). He rolls a 73 (a yellow FEAT) and manages to create 20 ounces of 24K gold that will disintegrate in 60,000 turns (about 4 days). He hurries to the local gold bullion dealer. Unfortunately, the dealer was warned about Synthos. He will accept the gold on the condition that he can wait one week before turning over payment. Each ounce the hero creates temporarily robs him of one Health point. The hero can recover any Health lost in this way after a 24-hour period, including eight hours of sleep. He must get his full rest to recover his Power; this saves the Judge and player from quibbling over fractions regained by naps and so on. (if you like to quibble, though, then go ahead and use partial recovery.) Thus the hero can only create a number of ounces equal to his Health. Example: Synthos needs that money now! He slinks into an alley and tries it again. A yellow FEAT results in 20 more ounces of unstable-gold. Realizing he's near his limit, he makes a final try to create nine more ounces. He succeeds with a red FEAT. A very pale Synthos trudges off to find a pawnshop. The hero can use this Power as an attack by trying to materialize new elements on a chosen target. The target can dodge the attack; if successful, the materialization occurs in the target's former location. The target must be in line of sight and not protected by any barriers. For example, Synthos sees an old foe and tries to give him a faceful of coal dust. He didn't notice that his foe was behind an extremely clear pane of glass. Synthos splatters coal dust all over his side of the window. Various Power stunts include: <ul><li>Dropping freshly-made weights on a target.

The new life can be of any nature, although it can only possess Powers that are intrinsic to its physical structure. The size of the new lifeform is limited by its weight. The hero can create in a single turn a maximum number of ounces equal to his Power rank number. Since the lifeform cannot be assembled in several pieces, but rather must be done all at once, this limits how large the creation is. It can grow, though, if it has the time. The lifespan of this new creation is determined at its genesis. A green FEAT gives it a lifespan of 100 turns times the hero's Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 times the number. On a red FEAT, the lifeform is permanent. Each ounce of created life costs the hero one Health point. All points lost in this way are automatically regained after 24 hours. In a single day, the hero can only create lifeforms whose total weight does not exceed his Health. The hero must have detailed knowledge of any organism he wants to create. He can only store a limited number of organic designs within his memory. The total number of memory slots available for this Power is equal to his Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the organisms he can create. The list can be changes at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the hero a new design. If there are no available memory slots, an old design is discarded to make room for the new one. Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of existing organisms. The hero must make a detailed study of the original for at least one hour before attempting a FEAT to memorize it. A failure means the hero must study the organism for another hour before attempting another FEAT. With sufficiently bad luck, the hero may never be able to memorize certain lifeforms One note: This Power includes a mixture of Detection Powers that permit the hero to study a lifeform down to its atomic level without having to do anything harmful to that lifeform (like dissect it). The hero can create new lifeforms based solely on his imagination and basic knowledge of anatomy and physiology. This requires an active imagination, intense concentration, and a red FEAT to memorize a viable design. The newly born lifeform has the same characteristics as a normally born lifeform of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary creations, the player and Judge should agree on a reasonable set of statistics for the being in question. This Power also includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. This can be used to create raw biological materials or foodstuffs; examples include sugar, blood, protoplasm, and so on. Each material takes up a memory slot. The hero can materialize his creation at any site within one area. The new life is initially stationary but can immediately begin to move under its own power. Like the rest of the Matter Creation Powers, this Power is stopped by the first barrier between the hero and the site of his intended target. So, no, people-you can't have your hero inject nasty germs directly into his opponent. As stated before, this Power can create living replicas of actual beings. The minds of such beings are not as complex as the original, and lack most of the original's memories and all Powers that are not strictly Physical in nature. For game purposes, new life has the following statistics: <table><tr><td>Fighting</td><td>-1CS</td></tr><tr><td>Agility</td><td>-1CS</td></tr><tr><td>Strength</td><td>no shift</td></tr><tr><td>Endurance</td><td>no shift</td></tr><tr><td>Reason</td><td>Poor</td></tr><tr><td>Intuition</td><td>Poor</td></tr><tr><td>Psyche</td><td>no shift</td></tr><tr><td>Health</td><td>no shift</td></tr><tr><td>Karma</td><td>zero</td></tr><tr><td>Resources</td><td>zero</td></tr><tr><td>Popularity</td><td>no shift</td></tr></table> Only physical Powers are duplicated. Talents' are lost as are Contacts, unless the Contact seeks out the duplicate. New life can learn, if it lives long enough. It can even raise its abilities and gain simulations of other Powers the original possesses. The Judge should set his own standards, based on what type of beastie the hero has come up with. Here comes the exception to all that's been written here so far. When creating the hero, the player can opt to specialize in creating one unique being, like a Pegasus or a She-Hulk of the hero's very own.

Red FEATs are treated as yellow FEATs, thus the hero is required to periodically recreate his chosen companion. Such a continually created being retains its memory from creation to creation and can learn and develop just like any normal lifeform. Any damage suffered by this being disappears when it is summoned anew. If slain, the being immediately disintegrates and its statistics (when it is summoned again) drop to their original levels. The hero should also incur a hefty Karma loss if he was directly responsible for his companion's death. If the hero possesses other Powers, the player can assign them to whatever lifeforms the hero can summon. This is an interesting possibility for creating unique characters, especially if Specialization is chosen.

The hero can also create new designs based solely on his imagination and knowledge of mechanical engineering.

The hero can also drop the machine on a target, but that is a real waste of material, people. The Power cannot create actual living beings. If the -hero is trying to create a facsimile of a living being, the best he can do is a robotic replica, complete with simulated flesh. Internal examination immediately reveals gears and pulleys. The Power can create potentially sentient machines, such as a miniature copy of a Sentinel.

The Power includes an innate, unconscious use of Speechthrowing. Although the hero actually provides the voice, it appears that the target actually speaking. When the Power is used to speak a corpse, it uses an unconscious, automatic form of Postcognition to create a simulation of the spirit that once inhabited the body. The hero does not speak with the actual spirit. This can lead to an odd situation in which the actual ghost hears his own body speak as if he were still in it. Unfortunately, the hero may develop a personality quirk that blurs the distinction between life and death. As he can speak with both the living and the dead, he might not be able to see what the difference is. This can be taken to grotesque extremes, especially in a horrific campaign. The Power can be used to pry into a person's secrets by interrogating that person's possessions.

However, the research for the Ultimate Powers Book showed that extreme levels of Intelligence can be a Power in its own right. Examples include The Leader and the late Soviet scientist known only as Gargoyle. The hyper-intelligent character is a genius of awesome potential. He can quickly master new subjects, retain that knowledge indefinitely, and easily succeed in any mental endeavor. There are two ways the Power can be incorporated into a character. The player should choose one when he first creates the character (a coin toss will do). The first method is a permanent modification of the hero's Intelligence. The Power rank number is added to the hero's previously generated Reason or Intuition rank number. The total is the hero's actual Hyper-intelligence. For example, a character like the Leader started off with Good Reason. The gamma rays added Incredible Hyper- Intelligence for a final total of Amazing Reason rank. The second method uses Hyper- Intelligence the same way most other Powers are used-intermittently. Just as Siryn doesn't scream all the time, so too would a Hyper-intelligent character have normal intelligence most of the time. When he uses his Power, he transforms himself into a mental giant. The way it operates is the character's normal rank for either Reason or Intuition is raised the number of levels equal to the Power rank (Feeble is +1CS, Poor +2CS, and so on). The total is the actual Hyper-Intelligence rank the character can achieve using this Power. The hero can retain this higher rank for a limited amount of time; the duration is the number of minutes equal to the original Ability's rank number. This is for the first time each day the hero uses the Power. Each successive time the hero uses his Power within the same day decreases the duration -1CS.

It is a permanent enhancement of the hero's overall intelligence that is channeled into the field of mechanical design and engineering. The hero is an Edison-like genius who take existing materials and technologies and use them to create new devices or applied technologies. He can repair previously operational devices, even if the device was of an unknown type. The hero can learn new technologies at a rate determined by his rank, the complexity of the technology, and the amount of instruction available. Modern technology requires an Excellent Intensity FEAT. Advanced technology requires a Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Alien or futuristic technology vary from Incredible Intensity (Shi'ar) to Unearthly (the Watcher). The color of the FEAT is determined by the amount of instruction the hero receives. A green FEAT requires instructional materials that explain the technology (a teacher, books, holocubes). A yellow FEAT is required if the hero has access to materials not specially designed to instruct someone in that technology (readouts, performance specs, operating manuals, a copy of a working device).

This Power allows the hero to remember the details of his more recent lives and to actually communicate with them. Such communications include the transmission of the complete range of senses and thoughts. There are two limits on communication with other lives. One, the communication can only be initiated by the hero's current incarnation. He cannot be called by past lives nor can he call future lives. However, that doesn't prevent the hero from receiving messages from his future selves. This can be a quick way to start an adventure (more later). Two, the hero can only reach past selves at points when they are actually living. He cannot reach selves that are in an afterlife situation. In fact, the hero can't really recall ever being in any form of afterlife. The Power rank number is also the number of consecutive past lives the hero can contact. The earliest incarnation is the lifespan in -which the Power first appeared; it has been growing one point at a time ever since. This limit spares the player the responsibility for making up a mega-biography going back to the dawn of time. It spares the Judge by limiting the potential havoc the player can wreak using his now-dead contacts. Assume a full but average lifespan for all past lives. From the 18th century on, this is 70 years. Prior to that, the average is 50. The time elapsed between incarnations is up to the player, but at least one incarnation per century is recommended. Soon after the player acquires this Power, he should work out a basic timeline for and list of his past incarnations. Players are urged to make their past lives relatively normal people. Still, if the player is determined to fill up his past with glory after glory, the Judge can insist on a simple rule. To wit: there is a 1% chance that any specific historical figure was a former incarnation of the present-day hero. The Power is used primarily to gain information. The hero can make extremely long-ranged plans that involve the assistance of past lives in solving current problems. Example: Self-1988 asks Self-1920 to have a tunnel dug under the site of the present day Latverian Embassy. A trust fund to be set up by Self-1855 will pay for it. Sometimes a future incarnation will request that the hero perform a special act. The reason for the act might never be explained. In this, way, the hero and his associates might suddenly find themselves thrust into extremely strange or terribly mundane situations. (\"It is crucial that you make sure Jon Clifton gets to school today! Then bury ten pounds of Adamantium at these coordinates in the Gobi Desert.\") Even the best laid plans of mice and men go astray. Any time the hero asks a past-self to perform an action that has a direct, physical effect on the present, he must make a FEAT roll. This represents the chance of long-range plans coming to fruition. Each century between the present-self and the past-self raises the Intensity FEAT +1CS. Example: The Trust Fund set up in 1855 requires a Poor Intensity FEAT. The tunnel requires a Feeble Intensity FEAT. The player rolled a 30 and a 56. The trust fund failed somewhere along the way but the tunnel got built anyway using alternative funding.

By using his Iron Will, the hero can temporarily halt the damage done by mental or physical attacks; he can even postpone his own death. Iron Will can be used in place of any lower-ranked Ability to determine Resistance to an attack. Any time the hero suffers damage from an attack, the Power can temporarily absorb it before it can affect any of the hero's Ability ranks. The maximum amount of damage Iron Will can absorb at one time is equal to its rank number. Absorbed damage does not affect the hero at that time. Damage exceeding that amount affects the hero in its normal manner. The hero can maintain his Iron Will indefinitely but will eventually have to relax his self-control in order to heal and renew his Power. Letting down his control causes him to immediately suffer a loss of Health points equal to one half the amount of damage Iron Will had absorbed. Regardless of the original nature of the attack, it is always translated into lost Health points; this reflects the strain the Power places on the body. Once the translation occurs and the Iron Will has been purged of its burden, it is able to absorb new damage.

The hero has the ability to rapidly learn any language if sufficient material is available for him to work with. Once the language is mastered, the hero is fluent in that language, provided he is physically capable of communicating in it. The number of languages a hero is currently fluent in is limited to the Power rank number. For example, Doug Ramsey's Incredible rank enables him to retain fluency in up to forty languages at a time. When a hero exceeds that limit, he begins to forget a previously mastered language. This will usually be some obscure tongue the hero has had little use for, like Basic Otter or Mephitish. The speed with which a hero can learn a new language is determined by its strangeness and what source materials are available. Current human languages require a Poor FEAT. Archaic human languages are a Good FEAT. Alien but Humanoid languages are Remarkable FEAT. Animal languages are an Incredible FEAT (note: not all animals have an actual language). Alien, nonhumanoid languages are an Amazing FEAT. The color of the FEAT is determined by the source of the language. A green FEAT is needed if the hero has access to actual instructional materials or a cooperative native speaker of that language who also speaks a language the hero knows. A yellow FEAT is needed if the hero has a native speaker who cannot speak any tongue the hero knows or if the hero only has non-instructional samples of that language. A red FEAT is needed if the hero has only fragments of the new language. For example, learning Shi'ar from watching a broadcast of a speech by Majestrix Lilandra is a yellow Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Learning spoken Primate by actually using sign language to talk with a chimpanzee requires a green incredible intensity FEAT. The hero can try a FEAT roll every hour. Failure means he simply has not yet gotten the hang of the new language. The only real drawback to the Power is that the hero may accidentally forget his native language, especially if he rarely uses it. Still, he can always re-learn it.

This is a great way to learn secrets and interrogate subjects who would otherwise be rather uncooperative (at best). The duplicated mind contains the personality of the original, most memories, and possibly the mental or psionic Powers of the original. The subject is unaffected by the Power and loses none of his own mental abilities. He is usually unaware that Duplication has even occurred. The relationship between the hero's and the duplicate’s mind takes one of three forms. The player must choose one form when he first creates the hero; this form applies for any duplicates the hero creates. <table><tr><td>Dice Roll</td><td>Form</td></tr><tr><td>01-40</td><td>Detachment</td></tr><tr><td>41-70</td><td>Merge</td></tr><tr><td>71-00</td><td>Transformation</td></tr></table> Detachment—The hero's mind is completely separate from the duplicate and retains full control over the body and other Powers. The hero can examine and communicate with the duplicate. The duplicate retains a facsimile of the original's will and may not choose to voluntarily cooperate with the hero. If the duplicate chooses to resist, the hero must make a Psyche FEAT whose Intensity is determined by the duplicate's Psyche rank. A successful FEAT means the duplicate will grudgingly cooperate (for now). The FEAT must be made with each new attempt to force cooperation. The duplicate mind can attempt to overwhelm the hero's own mind. Success occurs if the duplicate makes a -3CS Psyche FEAT whose intensity is based on the hero's Psyche. The duplicate mind can attempt its coup at the initial duplication and at any time the hero forces cooperation. Success means the two minds' positions are now reversed; the duplicate now controls the body and any Powers for the duration of the duplication. Example: Copicat successfully duplicates Dr. Doom's mind. Doom won't stand for anything resembling subservience and immediately rebels. Copicat has Excellent Psyche; Dr. Doom has Amazing Psyche, reduced -3CS to Excellent when attempting to overwhelm. The Doom-mind fails to make the required Excellent Intensity FEAT. \"Doom\" decides to examine his situation; from the Doom-mind's point of view, \"he\" has been captured by means of a Mind Transferral of unknown type. Copicat is trying to get the Doom-mind to draw up a set of plans for his time machine. Unfortunately Doom's Psyche is too high for even a red FEAT. Merge—The duplicate mind blends with the hero's mind to create a composite mentality. The new mind contains aspects of both minds' personalities, memories, and Powers. The new mind's Psyche is the sum of the original two Psyche ranks. The degree of each mind's influence is proportional to its original Psyche. Each original Psyche represents a section of the pooled Psyche. For example, Carboncopy has a Good Psyche. He merges with a Thing duplicate (Remarkable Psyche), creating a joint Incredible Psyche. One fourth of the joint personality is Carboncopy, the remaining three-quarters are the Thing. Transformation—The hero's mind is automatically overwhelmed by the new mind. The hero's personality, memories, and mental Powers are temporarily replaced by the new mind. The effects appear identical to Mind Transferral, at least where the hero is concerned. The hero's Reason and Intuition are replaced by those of the original mind; after expiration of the Power, these return to their original ranks. Regardless of the form, the hero must make a FEAT at the time of Duplication in order to determine the completeness of the duplicate mind. Any mind can be duplicated, regardless of its Psyche rank. The hero always duplicates the subject's personality and basic memories; the duplicate mind is an amnesiac. A green FEAT copies the subject's detailed memories. A yellow FEAT copies the subject's Talents. A red FEAT duplicates the subject's Mental and Psionic Powers. The range at which the hero can duplicate a mind is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate ranges are shown on Column A of the Range Table. The duration of the duplication is determined by the hero's Psyche rank. A duplicate mind has a duration of the number of minutes equal to the Psyche rank number. The duration decreases - 1CS for all duplicate-minds with each additional mind. For example, Copicat's Excellent Psyche enables him to maintain one duplicate-mind for 20 minutes or a maximum of five minds for two minutes. If the hero exceeds his limit, the new duplicate-mind will last for one turn and then all his copied minds will vanish. Note: the decreased duration only applies to the Detachment and Merge forms; the Transformation form can be used repeatedly since the latest duplication automatically erases the previous one. When the hero is created, the player must determine how much control the hero has over his Power. Failure to make at least a green Reason FEAT means the Power functions automatically, despite the hero's wishes. In the case of uncontrolled Power usage, the range at which duplication occurs drops to contact-only. The hero can maintain some control by covering all parts of her body that might normally touch another person's skin. For example, Rogue wears a full body covering complete with gloves. In rare cases, the duration of a specific duplicate mind can be extended to permanence. Such cases result from a combination of extremely peculiar factors. One such example occurred when Rogue's Mutant Power interacted with Ms. Marvel's Kree-Modified Human physiology. The result is that Rogue's mind permanently merged with a facsimile of Carol Danvers' mind.

For example, a Poor rank can see events of four weeks ago, an Amazing rank can look back almost one year, and a CL5000 rank can look back a century. The clarity of the vision is determined by what FEAT color is attained. A white roll lets the Judge say anything that comes to his head; accuracy and truthfulness are optional. (\"This doll was once a living child.\") A green FEAT gives vague impressions; the Judge should be honest about the real past but give only partial details. (\"A little girl held this doll.

The Power gives the hero sufficiently clear insight into upcoming events that he might be able to use that foreknowledge to his advantage. The problem lies in two areas, the flexibility of the timestream and the preparedness of the Judge (more on these later). Precognition is an awesome Power and thus has more limits than the Hulk can shake a stick at. (\"Hulk no need puny stick!\") The Power can normally be used only once per day at full rank. Each additional use decreases the rank -1CS down to a minimum of 1 turns lead-time. Second, the player must choose a limitation on the Power.

The Player cannot try to influence the dice by expending Karma. The Judge never tells the player the outcome or if he even threw the dice at all. This keeps the player from knowing the accuracy of his visions. Player characters can look into the future a number of hours equal to twice the Power rank number. For example, a Good rank can see almost a day ahead, an Unearthly rank can see over a week ahead, and a CL3000 rank can see eight months ahead. The color FEAT determines the accuracy of the vision. White results can be completely untainted by truth; the Judge can improvise to his heart's delight. (\"Three days from now… Sentinels fighting in space… an armada of aliens swarming upon them… A man named Jubal leads the aliens.\") A green result requires the Judge to be truthful but to only reveal basic details. A yellow FEAT requires full disclosure of anything the Judge can imagine being visible at the time of the vision's occurrence. A red FEAT enables the hero to learn things that might not be readily apparent at the time the vision comes to pass. One problem with the Power is that the timestream is extremely malleable. Each decision made creates an alternate timeline, a parallel Earth almost but not quite identical to the version of Earth where your campaign occurs. Each vision is an event that will come to pass in some timestream somewhere. It need not be the hero's impending timeline. That's where Precognition comes in. Each Precog vision gives the hero a chance to consciously shape his world's timeline. Because of this, the envisioned event might never come to pass, at least not where the hero is concerned. This leads to the second problem, that of Judge preparedness. To accurately and realistically portray Precog, the Judge would need to work out a detailed timeline of the campaign's future events, including variables that account for probable player actions. This is a major headache for Judges. This is a leading reason why Galactuses throughout the multiverse devour any world where Precognition appears. Precogs are therefore warned to use their Power carefully. Short-range Precog can be useful in combat. The hero can use his Power to discover his opponent's next move. This form can be used by any Precog, regardless of the limits otherwise constraining the Power. In game terms, the player tries to make a yellow FEAT at the start of each turn. Success means the Judge must reveal the NPCs' next moves. Initiative is rolled. If the Precog gets it, she has a chance to share her information with her teammates. This use of Precognition must be developed as a Power Stunt. The hero gains an advantage of +1CS when she has a Precog flash pertaining to friends, special enemies, possessions and dwelling places. This increases to +2CS if the flash involves dire events occurring to the Precog herself. The Power can be psychologically damaging to the Precog. The Power is often limited to times within the hero's own lifespan. Most of the time, there is no cause for alarm until the Power starts consistently failing. Delusions may result from frequent but inaccurate visions. Frequent, accurate visions of doom and destruction beyond the hero's capabilities may lead to aberrant behavior, such as chronic depression or chemical dependency.

The intensity rank is determined by the victim's Psyche. A successful FEAT enables the Psivampire to drain an amount of energy equal to his Power rank number. This amount is drawn in equal amounts from the victim's Reason, Intuition, and whatever Mental Powers he possesses. The process can continue indefinitely, with each successful FEAT enabling the Psi-vampire to drain more mental energy.

A red FEAT means he has entered an uncontrollable feeding frenzy that can only end when the victim is completely drained or the Psi-vampire has. been repelled. If the Psi-vampire fails to make a FEAT at any point in the feeding process, he is instantly repulsed by the victim and can never re-establish his attack.

The Psi-vampire distributes the gained energy among his Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and whatever Powers he has. He cannot raise this Power's rank; no Vampire of any type can ever raise his own Power rank. So why do Psi-vampires do it? The answer is they lose energy at a frightful rate. The rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and all his Powers (except this one) each drop one point per hour. The Psi-vampire must feed in order to return the affected Abilities to their original ranks. This also explains why Vampires are so rare: lower ranked Vampires must constantly feed and are therefore easily detected and destroyed.

He can accelerate the body's physical development in order to induce birth and quickly regain physical maturity. The rate of accelerated development is a multiplier equal to the Power rank number. A Feeble rank ages twice as fast as normal, a Remarkable rank ages one month for each day that passes, and a Shift-Z can age over a year for each real day. Example: Avengers #200 revealed that Immortus' son Marcus had entered the Earth Dimension by way of an embryo he had implanted in Ms. Marvel's body. He was born within weeks of her discovering she was pregnant and grew into a seeming 20-year-old within a day of his birth. Mental Powers are immediately transferred to the new body. Physical Powers are regained as the body matures. The Judge can decide how and when the Powers reappear. Powers that are derived externally or result from massive alterations of the hero's original form are not transferred. The hero will have to recover or recreate the source of these Powers in order to regain them. Premade—The new body is a previously prepared clone or android body that was prepared specifically for this purpose. Such a body is already physically mature and in possession of the full range of the hero's Powers. It is completely mindless and rests in a comatose state until activated by the hero's lifeforce. The knowledge of how to create these bodies can be learned by characters with Remarkable or better Reason, provided they are properly trained. Someone with Amazing Reason can figure it out for himself. A Laboratory or Medical Package of Amazing cost is required to create these bodies. Each body has an Remarkable cost. Magically created bodies require an equivalent Resource level. If a premade body is unavailable at the time the old one dies, the lifeforce drifts in Limbo until such a body becomes available. Re-animation—The lifeforce enters and revives a recently deceased but unmutilated corpse, preferably of the same species as the original body. The body must be reasonably intact, although the Power does include a single-use form of Self-healing that repairs the body and restarts bodily functions. The hero can not control which body he enters but rather is drawn to one in the following order of preference: 1) closest to old body, 2) most recently dead, and 3) least severe damage. Mental Powers are immediately transferred. Most physical Powers are regained as the hero-re shapes the new body to accommodate the Powers' use. Powers that are external must be recovered or recreated. The amount of time needed to reshape the body is the number of days equal to 100 minus the Power rank number. If the corpse has intrinsic Powers, the hero gains the use of these upon re-animating the corpse. Such Powers are not transferred to subsequent bodies. The re animated body regains full life within a day of the Power's use. Spontaneous Creation—This is the most sociably acceptable form of Serial Immortality. The hero creates existing matter and energy into the flesh of a new body. The newly-created body is identical to the previous one and possesses all Powers except externally derived ones. Any Power that is in the hero's self-image can transfer. The time needed to create a new body is the number of days equal to 100 minus the Power rank number. Parasite—This is the nastiest, least socially acceptable form of Serial Immortal ity. The character's lifeforce invades a living, physically mature body and overwhelms the original occupant's mind. Successful invasion is determined by pitting the Power rank against the would-be victim's Psyche. The invader must make a Power FEAT whose intensity is equal to the victim's Psyche. Failure means the invader must choose another victim. If the invasion succeeds, the original mind suffers one of five possible fates; the player must choose one that holds for all victims of this Power. There is an equal random chance for each. Subordination: The victim retains consciousness and individuality but loses all physical control. He is a prisoner in his own body. Merger: The victim's mind is incorporated into the greater mind of the invader. Comatose: The victim's mind is rendered unconscious for the duration of the invasion. Obliteration: The victim's mind is completely destroyed. Eviction: The victim's mind is driven out of his body and becomes a Free Spirit (see M11). It is incredibly difficult to finally defeat an adversary with any form of Serial Immortality. The best the foe can normally hope for is to defeat the current body and then prepare for the next incarnation. It is possible to stop the infinite progression from body to body by preventing the hero from leaving his current body (suspended animation will do) or entering a new one (stranding the hero in intergalactic space is a good tactic). The lifeforce can be directly fought or even killed within the Limbo dimension. Sometimes a character with this Power can be forced out of his current body without that body getting killed in the process. The Judge is free to decide what conditions apply in his campaign; suggested moans revolve around coercion or such Powers as Magic, Power Controls, Force Field vs. Hostiles, Summoning, and Exorcism. Such Powers must exceed the hero's Power rank by 2CS in order to forcibly evict the lifeforce from the body. If successful, the lifeforce is driven into Limbo or a new body in a more peaceful location. As for the now vacated body, the results vary with the form and variety of Serial Immortality: Newborn—The body is now occupied by the innocent soul of a newborn infant, regardless of the body's physical age. Premade—\"He's dead, Jim.\" Re-animation—\" She's dead, Jim.\" Creation—The body reverts to its original materials. Parasite/Subordination—The victim awakens with full knowledge of his past plight. Parasite/Merger—The victim awakes but is temporarily schizoid due to lingering effects of the merger. Parasite/Comatose—The victim awakons with no knowledge of the intervening time. Parasite/Obliteration—\"This one's dead, too.\" Parasite/Eviction—The body is comatose but will revive when the original mind rejoins the body. The Nemesis is Exorcism."),

The permanent form is a lasting modification to the hero's appearance and physiology. The temporary form allows the hero to retain his normal human appearance and identity. When the need arises, the hero can manifest his Power and transform himself into his armored self. The advantage of the permanent form is that hero is always protected. The disadvantage is that the hero may be a physical freak. The advantage to the temporary from is that the hero can live a relatively normal life when he is not performing heroic deeds. The disadvantages are twofold. One, the hero lacks his protective skin most of the time and two, the temporary form is only available at a cost of -2CS to the Power rank.

The Thing's orange rock-like exterior is an example of this. Non-organic—The body actually is covered in inorganic material.

He cannot be mechanically detected or recorded (i.e. by photography or television) and is immune to attacks using visible light (lasers, mostly). At Good rank and higher, the invisibility range can be extended to cover other sections of the energy spectrum (infrared and ultraviolet light, radiowaves, hard radiation); this also bestows immunity to attacks using these forms. At these levels the hero can also extend the area of invisibility beyond his body. This permits the hero to protect others and, more importantly, to wear clothing. (H.G. Wells' Invisible Man was unable to even conceal undigested food within his body.) Telepathic: The hero is actually visible but is ignored and immediately forgotten by beings who would otherwise be capable of detecting his presence. He is also immune to detection by other senses. (\"Did you hear anything? Nah.\") He can be mechanically detected and re corded (this is where this Power gets weird); a video monitor or alarm that reveals the hero's presence will be ignored by anyone within range of the hero's Power. Photographic film records the hero, but anyone looking at it while within range of the hero's Power will ignore the hero's image. Anyone outside this range can see the hero quite clearly, and will be very confused about the lack of reaction by those around the hero. He can extend this invisibility to anyone in physical contact with him. If the hero loses touch (literally) with someone whom he was protecting in this way, that person is immediately susceptible to the Power's effect and forgets that the hero was ever there. Robots and cybernetic beings are unaffected by this Power, but they can be protected by it. The Power does not affect any light-based attack but does provide protection against psionic attacks (-2CS for the attacker). Hallucinatory: The hero is actually visible but is surrounded by a telepathic field that makes others see an empty spot where the hero is. The Hallucination can incorporate the hero's surroundings and affect real-time viewers at a great distance. In other words, the hero can disguise the area around himself and this disguise will fool anyone looking at the area, even if they are miles away. However, this Power doesn't fool film or videotape; these record the scene as it really is. Hallucination also prevents detection by other senses. The hero can be mechanically detected and recorded; as with the Telepathic form, anyone within, range o f the effect ignores the hero. Robots and cybernetic beings can also detect him. This Power provides no protection against light-based attacks, but does provide protection against psionic attacks (-2CS for the attacker). Holographic: The hero is actually visible but has surrounded himself with a holographic image of empty space. The holograph can incorporate a wide area and affects anyone within line of sight (if someone can see across interstellar space, the holograph fools you). The holograph can be mechanically detected and recorded as if it were real. It will not prevent detection by other senses. Robots and cybernetic life accept the holograph as real. It provides protection against light-based attacks equal to his Power rank -2CS. (Example: the Incredible rank provides Excellent Resistance.) The duration of any form of Invisibility is a function of the Power rank. This Power can be reduced in effectiveness or even terminated by certain acts, performed either by the hero or someone under the Power's effect. Simple physical contact can alert others to the hero's presence (Physics, Hallucinatory, Holographic). Physical attacks by the hero terminate the Invisibility (Telepathic) or reduce its protection by -1CS for each attack the hero makes (all other forms). A Invisible hero may find himself surrounded by a coating material (rain, dust, and paint for example). This only effects the Physics-based Invisibility. At Feeble, Poor, and Typical ranks the hero is visible for the duration of the coating. At Good or higher ranks, such coatings remain visible for the number of turns equal to eight minus the number of Power rank levels. (Example: Invisible Woman is struck by a balloon filled with paint. Her Power is Excellent and renders the paint invisible in three turns.) There is a base 2% chance that the Invisibility is permanent (4% if the hero is alien). Such a state can only be negated by nullifying the Power itself, permanently. Previously controllable Invisibility can be made permanent through brain damage or Powers that affect the hero's control."),

His weight decreases to a percentage equal to his power rank number. For example, the Vision’s Unearthly rank in this power decreases his weight by 100%, making him completely weightless.

The added weight is a percentage of his normal body weight; for example, a 160 lb. man with Shift Z rank in this power can carry an additional 800 pounds (500% of 160 lbs.).

No matter how much the hero weighs, he can still move as if he were his normal weight. Lifting strength remains the same. Of course, as the hero weighs more, he has a greater effect on the environment. At 2,940 pounds, our hero can fall through previously sound flooring or collapse the shocks on his 1973 VW Beetle. Physical force has a decreased effect on the hero because of his greater mass. In game terms, the power gives the hero power rank resistance to physical attacks. The hero can also use the power rank instead of his strength to inflict charging damage. Formerly weak characters can embarrass their adversaries with this new-found might.

The hero’s power rank must exceed the barrier’s material strength in order for Phasing to occur. The hero can Phase through Force Fields, Body Armors, Resistances, and Invulnerabilities of lower ranks by making a green FEAT. Because the hero is out of phase with normal matter, he cannot breathe. Thus, the practical duration limit on this power is the length of time the hero can hold his breath. If the hero has some way around this problem, the duration is unlimited. Note that if the power is somehow “turned on” permanently, as happened to Kitty Pryde, the power gains the ability to transform air into phased particles that the hero can breathe. In the Marvel Universe, Phasing has a damaging effect on delicate electronic devices. By Phasing through such devices, the hero can disrupt normal activity and scramble any on-line programming. If, during the character creation process, the player decides to forego this side effect, he can raise his hero’s power rank +1CS. For modesty’s sake, it is assumed that the power also transforms the hero’s clothing and carried possessions into phased matter. The power’s side effect automatically scrambles any electronics the hero is carrying (Kitty Pryde wears a wind-up watch, never a digital one). If the player wants to risk his hero’s modesty for the sake of a more realistic game, the player can assume either that the power only transforms whatever the hero was wearing when he first got this power (severely limiting the hero’s wardrobe) or that there is a base 70% chance that the power automatically transforms whatever the hero is wearing at the time.

In any case, the Gestalt hero will have a normal appearance. No two-headed, split- torsoed freak results, unless this Power is distorted in some way. Interference by such Powers as Magic or Power Control may result in the Gestalt hero forming as a freak. The hero can still revert to his normal selves, though, no matter how weird he gets (the Judge may want to require an Unearthly FEAT, though, at his discretion). Both or all normal selves are required to form the Gestalt. If one is unavailable, the Power cannot function. Damage to a normal self is carried over to the Gestalt self; for example, if one person has a whomping head cold, so will the Gestalt. However, the Gestalt hero's superior recuperative faculties can quickly repair any such illness. The normal and Gestalt selves never co-exist except under extraordinary circumstances (see  Alter Ego). The Gestalt mind may be a schizoid combination of each of the normal minds, or be a completely independent mind.

Even Strength is undiminished, although it is much harder for a shrunken hero to gain enough leverage to perform tasks that would otherwise be simple to perform. For example, consider the act of sharpening a pencil if you are only ladybug-size. As the hero shrinks, he becomes harder to hit but conversely suffers greater damage if struck. This is handled by the column shift as shown in the table below. The column shift decreases the attacker’s chance to hit and increases the damage by an equal shift.

Either CL1000 or CL3000 will reduce him to atomic scale. CL5000 reduces him to the point at which he can enter microverse worlds. On such worlds, the hero is proportional to his new environment. There are three forms of this power. When the power or the hero is first created, the player must determine which form is involved, using the following subtable. <table><tr><td>Die Roll</td><td>Form</td></tr><tr><td>01-20</td><td>Atomic Collapse</td></tr><tr><td>21-40</td><td>Atomic Reduction</td></tr><tr><td>41-00</td><td>Atomic Shrinkage</td></tr></table> Atomic Collapse decreases the distance between the body’s atoms and subatomic particles, thus decreasing overall size. Mass and strength are unaffected. As density increases, the hero’s body could collapse into neutronium (CL3000) or into a black hole (CL5000). Atomic Reduction decreases the number of atoms in the hero’s body. The lost atoms are either disintegrated (if the shrinkage is permanent) or temporarily removed from the hero’s plane of existence and stored “elsewhere” until the hero reverts to his original size. Both mass and strength decrease as the hero shrinks; these ranks remain proportional to the hero’s new size. If the hero loses too many atoms (by exceeding Shift X rank), his remaining structure becomes too simple to sustain his life force. For this reason, a hero with this form cannot voluntarily exceed Unearthly rank. If the limit is passed, the hero’s lifeforce is automatically stored away on the same plane with all the displaced matter that normally forms his body. At Shift Z rank, the hero’s body consists of a single DNA molecule, which then vanishes when the next rank is reached. Atomic Shrinkage reduces the size of the hero’s atoms, thus reducing overall size and mass. Strength remains proportional to the hero’s current size. This is the only form that enables the hero to reach a microverse. While this is the most popular form of Shrinking, it has a potentially deadly disadvantage. As the hero’s atoms shrink, they can no longer interact with other, normal-size atoms. As a result, the hero cannot breathe, drink, or eat normal-size matter. Fortunately, there is a flat 95% chance (determined at the time this power is first gained) that the power envelops the hero with an aura that temporarily reduces all atoms to be consumed. If the hero lacks this aura, he must have a proportionally sized supply of material for consumption or somehow not need to breathe. If not, the duration for this power is equal to the time the hero can hold his breath. There is an advantage to not possessing this aura in that electrons cannot flow from normal to shrunken matter; hence, the power acts as rank-level Resistance to Electricity. The optional power is MC4/Diminution. The nemesis is MC6/Enlargement; the specific forms are, in order, Atomic Dispersal, Atomic Gain, and Atomic Growth (see Enlargement)."){

To an onlooker, the hero appears to have transformed himself into a life-size photograph. The hero’s body functions and abilities are unaffected. Because the hero is now extremely thin, gaining leverage on three-dimensional objects is extremely difficult. He is also extremely hard to hit if he can turn his flat side toward his opponents. While in a flattened state, the hero suffers less damage from blunt physical attacks; the power rank number decreases the damage by that much for each attack. On the other hand, a flat hero can suffer all sorts of abuse that he would normally ignore. For example, Flatman could be forcibly folded like a map and locked in a glove compartment! How thin the hero can get is determined by an Intensity FEAT. A green FEAT reduces the hero to the width of a piece of paper (about 1/256”). At this point, the hero can pass through the cracks around a door or adhere to a wall and pretend to be a poster. A yellow FEAT reduces the hero to one atom’s width. At this width, the hero can pass through solid barriers by slicing through them as if he were an incredibly fine knife. The power enables the hero to pass any barrier with a Material Strength up to +5CS greater than this power’s rank. Note that if the barrier is larger than the hero’s body (such as a wall), then the slice made by the hero’s passage immediately reseals itself. But, if the barrier was smaller than the hero (such as a chain), then the pieces fall apart as soon as the hero severs the entire width. A red FEAT removes the third dimension entirely; at this point, the hero can pass through barriers without damaging them, or he can be transported into a Flatland-type dimension where everyone has only two dimensions. In the latter case, the hero vanishes from sight. The hero can choose to flatten himself in any direction. He can appear to be a front-back, left profile-right profile, top view-bottom view, or similar-shaped twodimensional image. Note that while one dimension is drastically altered, the remaining measurements remain the same. When this power is applied to a weapon, the result is a micron-sword such as the one used by the late Nemesis. Such a blade completely severs any matter with a Material Strength up to +5CS greater than this power’s rank. The name “Two-Dimensionality” is a misnomer. While in the Marvel Universe it most commonly describes the ability of normal beings to pass into a Flatland-like state, it can also be used to shed more than one dimension.

Additional dimensions require development as Power Stunts. Once created, the bridge functions no matter how far the hero is in space, time, or the Multiverse.

The effects on the area the hero lands on might not be the same as if a normal jump occurred. Consider that the Hulk splinters the pavement when he lands. To determine what sort of effects occur when the hero lands, the Judge should figure what kind of damage results when a weight five times that of the hero suddenly drops on the surface in question. The actual landspeed varies with the angle of the leaps. The average landspeed for Hyper-leaping is a -3CS Land Movement rate. For example, an Excellent Leaper can travel 30 mph in a series of rapid 30-foot leaps. If the hero also possesses Hyper-speed, that can be added to this Power's rank number for additional speed by increasing the frequency but not the size of the leaps. Physical burdens do not decrease the hero's speed, although they might decrease his control. Anything the hero is carrying is also protected by the innate safeguards against damage; the hero acts as a shock-absorber. While the hero has a vague idea of where he is going, he can't see his touchdown point. This can be a real hazard when the hero can make Monstrous leaps or better.

For example, Dr. Doom's time platform makes virtually instantaneous trips while Kang's timeship travels at a rate of one year per turn. The theories behind Time travel vary on the flexibility of the past. Two theories stress the immutability of the timestream. The first theory states that all events are fixed; if you travel into the past, you are destined to perform those actions or some unknown force either prevents or negates your actions. (The Collector suddenly appears and stops Darkstar from assassinating a ten-year-old Abraham Lincoln.) The second theory states that the traveler actually travels to an alternate timeline that closely resembles the desired segment of the past. By changing this timeline, the hero cuts himself loose from his original timeline and is now linked to the one he has created. (Darkstar assassinates Lincoln. The U.S. breaks up during the Civil War and never becomes a world power. Darkstar emerges in a new present where the U.S.S.R.'s chief rival is Anglo-American Codominion. Meanwhile on Earth-Marvel, the Avengers intercept a secret Soviet communique that deals with Darkstar's disappearance while on a mission.) The third theory states that there is only one timestream but it can be completely changed at any point when a traveler from the future alters a part of the past. (Alison Blaire of Her Majesty's Special Guard brings her superior, Lord Warren, Earl of Worthington, an intercepted Soviet report dealing with the appearance and subsequent elimination of a superhuman who called herself Darkstar.) Villains and well-meaning but misguided types tend to believe the third theory. This is a false belief since the structure of the Marvel Universe actually follows the second theory.

        Troubleseeker(PowerClass.Travel, "Troubleseeker", 1, 0.02, "<b>Troubleseeker</b>: Heroes hate this Power but it does tend to get an adventure going quickly. The Power combines Teleportation with automatically functioning Mental and Detection Powers. The hero subconsciously detects a crisis somewhere within his range and automatically teleports to the vicinity. The maximum range for detection and Teleportation is shown on column E of the Range Table. The hero has no control over the Power. He usually arrives without any idea of what the problem is that drew him. His only warning is the dreaded feel of the Power beginning to function. (A brief tingle, a muttered \"Here I go again,\" and poof!) Nothing in the Marvel Universe can prevent the hero from teleporting into a crisis area. His unwanted appearance can only be prevented by nullifying the Power before it functions. This can be accomplished by negating either the detection, analyzing, or transportational aspects of the Power (more on this later). Once he is drawn to the scene, the hero can move freely about. He must remain within 10 areas of the initial attraction. If the hero goes beyond that limit, he is instantly teleported back to his starting place. Only when the crisis has been dealt with can the Troubleseeker leave the area. (Of course, the Power is also free to draw him to a new crisis elsewhere.) To compensate for the constant demands the Power places on the hero, it increase the hero's Endurance by this Power's rank number. At Amazing rank, the hero gains the additional Power of Self Teleportation. The 10-area limit remains in effect. The Power automatically transports anything the hero considers part of his self image. This can be extended to include clothing, equipment, and even companions. The additional weight is limited to the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. Example: The Troubleseeker known only as The Medic possesses a CL3000 rank. This allows him to transport 1.5 tons of additional mass. This is represented by a hut full of equipment and at least two (sometimes unwilling) passengers. What attracts the Troubleseeker? The Detection aspects of the Power operate on an Empathic basis. The crisis that attracts it is one that generates extreme levels of turbulent emotions (fear, hate, pure evil, general anguish, and so on). An event that doesn't directly affect anyone will not attract the Troubleseeker. A screening mechanism prevents the hero from traveling to \"false alarms\" such as a distressed accountant who just lost his ledgers. If the hero possesses Dimension Travel, it is automatically incorporated into this Power to extend its range. The result is that the Troubleseeker can be drawn to crises on an infinity of alternate worlds. If the hero possesses Time Travel, the Power can usurp control of this as well. The hero travels to a random location in time and then teleports to a crisis occurring within that time place. The Power does allow the hero to rest between missions. The Power will not function again until 1-10 days after the successful conclusion of the previous mission. If the mission was unsuccessful, the Power functions again 1-10 hours after the hero's defeat. The hero has a -1CS resistance to Emotion attacks. Even worse, a perfect simulation of the emotions that accompany extreme distress can serve as a trap to lure and hold the Troubleseeker. The Troubleseeker cannot leave the 10 area limit until he has discovered the deception and neutralized the source of the spurious emotions. The Troubleseeker resents his Power and often feels he is a puppet dancing at the whim of an unseen master. The Power is controlled by a force beyond the hero's discovery. Whatever its nature, the Power will never try to get the hero killed. The screening mechanism never draws the hero to a crisis that is beyond his ability to handle, though he might not think so at the time. If the hero admits or suffers total defeat, the Power may even allow him to escape. If the hero is in a fatal situation with absolutely no way out, the Judge rolls a red Power FEAT. Success means the hero is teleported to safety, at the loss of all his Karma. The Power works against the Troubleseeker's opponents if they try to carry him away from the area. Such attempts to hijack the hero proceed normally until the 10-area limit is reached. At that point the hero immediately teleports back to his starting place, minus whatever had carried him away. As mentioned earlier, the only way to prevent the Troubleseeker's unwanted appearance is to somehow prevent the Power from initially functioning. The detection aspect can be temporarily blinded by such means as Mental Invisibility or Force Field vs. either Mental or Emotional Attack. If the villain operates so covertly that no one gets distressed, this will also do. The key is prevent the hero from receiving the broadcast emotions. The second mode of prevention deals with the analysis aspect. Anything that can reduce the hero's Reason or Intuition to below Typical can prevent him from recognizing distress as something that demands his attention. Means to this end include Hypnotic Control, Emotion, Control, Induced Sleep, Mind Drain, and Psionic Vampirism. The third mode is simple enough. The villain need only negate the hero's ability to Teleport. Note: the hero may actually thank the villain for this, if the villain is able to pass himself off as a benefactor."),
        TrueFlight(PowerClass.Travel, "True Flight", 1, 0.09, "<b>True Flight</b>: The hero can fly through air and space without an apparent means of propulsion. This is the most desired Power in the history of the world. The Power rank determines the maximum speed the hero can attain in a specific condition. There are three mediums in which a hero can fly. The slowest form of Flight occurs when the hero torpedoes through the water at the Water Movement rate. Faster speed occurs when the hero flies through the air at the Air Movement rate. The fastest flight occurs when the hero is free of any hindering atmospheric friction; this is the Space Movement rate. Acceleration occurs at a rate of +1CS per turn. Deceleration occurs at -2CS per turn. The hero's maneuverability is determined by his Agility. The hero may be able to surpass light speed but if he has Feeble Agility he is going to need a wide turning radius. True Flight includes as a side effect Power rank resistance to atmospheric friction and lungs adapted to breathe high velocity wind. It does not include the ability to breathe water or survive the rigors of outer space. When creating the hero, the player can define the Power in any way that is consistent with the character or his equipment.

The pathway smoothes the water's surface to an average wave height and is not affected by waves of equal or less Intensity. The path slides along the water's surface. This permits the hero to travel at Power rank speed and the Water Movement rate. The Path only exists for the hero to use. It is intangible to others unless the hero can physically carry them or directly extend his Power to them. This can be done in two ways. One, when the hero is created, the player can decrease his Power rank -1CS by modifying the Power to extend 10' around the hero. This area will support others, provided their combined weight does not exceed the hero's weight limit. The second method requires the use of another Power that can enable others to independently use the watery pathway; such Powers include Power Transferral and Creation. The Power normally functions only when the hero is consciously using it. The hero can develop a Power Stunt that enables him to maintain the path's solidity even when the hero is unconscious. The Power only affects water itself. It provides no protection against anything within the water. For example, a shark could rub the hero's soles as he walked. Water currents and high waves can slow, speed along, or redirect the hero's progress. High waves become the equivalent of self-propelled hills. Fast current;s can change the hero's speed. Opposing currents decrease the hero's speed by the current's Intensity rank number. Supporting currents increase the hero's speed by the same amount. Waves and currents can be natural or created by such Powers as Matter Animation or Weather Control. The Nemesis is Matter Animation/Liquid."),

Passengers are not battered by the high winds but are safely held aloft by updrafts in the cyclone's interior. Still, all passengers must make an Endurance FEAT or become air sick. The Power provides rank level Resistance to Physical and Sonic attacks. High winds can affect the hero. Strong winds decrease the Power rank by their Intensity rank number.
