# marvel-rpg-character-creator
An automated character creator for the Marvel Super Heroes tabletop RPG game from the '80's, using the rules laid out in the Ultimate Powers Book (as much as that's possible given how self-contradictory and confusing they were) and population data from the 2010 census to generate random demographics.  Great for coming up with random concepts.
